          <p>
            If we want to fully understand how big the problem of fixing the
            world is, and why it’s so important that we do, we need to first
            zoom out…..

            IMAGINE IF ALL of human history were written down in a fat book
            called The Story of Us.

            Humans have been around for a long, long time—according to the
            most recent estimates, between 200,000 and 300,000 years. If every
            page of The Story of Us covered 250 years of history, the book
            would be about 1,000 pages long. To take a closer look, let’s tear
          </p>
          <p>all the pages out and lay them on the table:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="side">
          <div class="image">
            <img src="Images/image59.webp" alt="Image59" loading="lazy" class="skeleton-img" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            When we really zoom out, we see that most of what we consider
            ancient history is really just the very last pages of the story.
            The Agricultural Revolution starts around page 950 or 960,
            recorded history gets going at about page 976, and Christianity
            isn’t born until page 993.
          </p>
          <p>
            A.D. is over 2,000 years long, which sounds like a long time,
            until you realize that humans have been around for over 2,000
            centuries.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are exceptions: 7th century Europe (page 995) was, for
            instance, less technologically advanced than 2nd century Europe
            (page 993) at the height of the Roman Empire. But most of the
            time, technology moves in one overarching direction: forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            Page 1,000, which goes from the early 1770s to the early 2020s,
            contains all of U.S. history.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re now collectively venturing into the mysterious new world of
            page 1,001. This excites me—and also scares me—because of three
            concurrent facts.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="headh2">Fact 1:<span> Technology is exponential</span></h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Say we went back to page 760 of The Story of Us, kidnapped
            someone, and transported them a few centuries forward to page 761.
            Other than having to find new friends and make some cultural
            adjustments, they’d probably get along fine, because the worlds of
            pages 760 and 761 were pretty much the same.

            For most of our history, that’s what it would be like to jump
            forward 250 years to the next page. But the closer you get to page
            1,000, the less the rule holds. Like, what if we did the same
            thing with someone on page 992, 998, or 999?

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            The later you lived in The Story of Us, the more mind-blowing it
            would be to jump forward to the next page. As you can see, our
            little person on page 999 was so shocked by the world he saw on
            page 1,000, he keeled over and died. We can see why when we
            compare page 1,000 to all the pages before it.

            It’s natural to assume that the world we grew up in is normal. But
            nothing about our current world is normal. Because technology is
            exponential. More advanced societies make progress at a faster
            rate than less advanced societies—because they’re more advanced.
            People in the 19th century knew more and had better technology
            than people in the 16th century, so it’s no surprise that there
            were more advances on page 1,000 than on page 999. Over the
            centuries, this builds upon itself, leading to increasingly rapid
            progress. And ever since the Middle Ages ended, human technology
            has been advancing on an exponential fast track, leading to a
            world on page 1,000 that would seem like a totally different
            planet to humans on any previous page.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="headh2">
          Fact 2:<span> Better Technology Means Higher Stakes</span>
        </h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Technology is a multiplier of both good and bad. More technology
            means better good times, but it also means “badder” bad times. On
            page 999 of human history, the Enlightenment and Scientific
            Revolution that generated vast improvements in human prosperity
            also generated an explosion of slavery and brutal imperialism.
          </p>
          <p>
            Page 1,000, a time of unprecedented life expectancy, wealth, and
            political freedom, also saw the two most catastrophic wars in
            history followed by existential threats with the invention of
            nuclear and biological weapons and the onset of climate change.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the times get better, they also get more dangerous. More
            technology makes our species more powerful, which increases risk.
            And the scary thing is, if the good and bad keep exponentially
            growing, it doesn’t matter how great the good times become. If the
            bad gets to a certain level of bad, it’s all over for us.
          </p>
          <p>
            So far in the 21st century, Fact 1 and Fact 2 seem to be holding
            strong. The pace of change has been dizzying, with the advent of
            widespread internet, social media, smart phones, self-driving
            cars, and crypto, not to mention the dramatic leaps in AI powering
            many of these advances. The jump in technology from page 1,000 to
            1,001 should prove to be even more extreme than the jump from 999
            to 1,000—maybe many times more so. This could be unfathomably
            awesome. We could conquer every problem that ails us today—
            disease, poverty, climate change, maybe even mortality itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if the catastrophes of page 1,000 were the most devastating
            yet, what does that mean about catastrophes on page 1,001? The
            same technology that has made our world magical has also opened a
            large number of Pandora’s boxes: rapidly advancing AI, cyber
            warfare, autonomous weapons, and bioweapons, to name a few.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the stakes this high, we’d want to be our wisest selves.
            Which is unfortunate, because:

          Fact 3:<span>
            Our society is currently acting like a poopy-pantsed four-year-old
            who dropped its ice cream.</span>

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            I picture society as a giant human—a living organism like each of
            us, only much bigger. And when I look at the American society
            around me, I’m not really seeing this:

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>It looks more like this:</p>

            <img src="Images/image64.webp" alt="Image64" loading="lazy" class="skeleton-img" />

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Humans are supposed to mature as they age—but the giant human
            world I live in has been getting more childish each year.
            Tribalism and political division are on the rise. False narratives
            and outlandish conspiracy theories are flourishing. Major
            institutions are floundering. Medieval- style public shaming is
            suddenly back in fashion. Trust, the critical currency of a
            healthy society, is disintegrating. And these trends seem to be
            happening in lots of societies, not just my own. So what’s our
            problem? Why, in a time so prosperous, with the stakes so high,
            would we be going backward in wisdom?
          </p>
          <p>
            This wouldn’t be the first time. In 1905, philosopher George
            Santayana issued a warning to humanity:
          </p>
          <p>
            | Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The worrying thing about that quote is that the philosopher Edmund
            Burke issued the same warning over a century earlier, in 1790:
          </p>
          <p>
            | People will not look forward to posterity, who never look
            backward to their ancestors.
          </p>
          <p>
            We seem to be having trouble learning an important lesson here.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we learn a technology lesson, we tend not to forget it. The
            invention of the integrated circuit in 1959 was a breakthrough
            that launched a new paradigm in modern computing. This isn’t the
            kind of thing we later forget, finding ourselves accidentally
            going back to making computers with vacuum tubes. But wisdom
            lessons don’t always seem to stick. Unlike technological growth,
            wisdom seems to oscillate up and down, leading societies to repeat
            age-old mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I look at the world around me today, I worry that we’re on our
            way toward making some terrible—and preventable—mistakes. When I
            think about Facts 1 and 2, I picture our societies as giants
            trudging upward on a mountain ridge toward a glorious future—but
            as they move upward, the ridge gets thinner and the cliffs on
            either side grow steeper. The higher we go, the more deadly a fall
            we risk. When I think about Fact 3, I see those giants losing
            their composure and becoming more erratic in their steps, at the
            worst possible time.

            If you were reading The Story of Us and turned the page to 1,001,
            everything would seem to be coming to a head, with many storylines
            suddenly converging. You’d be glued to the book, needing to find
            out what happens to this species.
          </p>
          <p>
            Except we’re not reading The Story of Us—we’re living inside of
            it, as its characters. We’re also its authors, writing the story
            as we go along.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our responsibility is immense. If we can figure out how to get
            page 1,001 right, Future Us and trillions of our descendants could
            live high up on that mountain in what would seem like a magical
            utopia to Today Us. However, If we get page 1,001 and stumble off
            those steep cliffs, this might be the last page of the story.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the authors of The Story of Us, we have no mentors, no editors,
            no one to make sure it all turns out okay. It’s all in our hands.
            This scares me, but it’s also what gives me hope. If we can all
            get just a little wiser, together, it may be enough to nudge the
            story onto a trajectory that points toward an unimaginably good
            future.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are someone who recognizes this as the potential final
            decade where humans matter relative to the exponential growth of
            machine intelligence, then you are like me. Thinking where to
            place one’s energy to get the greatest unlock for mankind.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may have gone down similar thought patterns like myself, or
            how if things DO GO WELL, they’ll go REALLY, REALLY WELL. Like so
            well that those religious stories every religion has about heaven,
            nirvana, or eternal fulfillment may actually be on to something.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you disregard those stories, you can still imagine that a world
            without disease or suffering, with as much time as you want, and
            enough resources as you want, IS going to be pretty awesome. With
            all time in the world and all the capability in the world for us
            to focus on each other’s happiness and well-being, it’d be silly
            to think we couldn’t do a good job.

            Yet still, we are not there, we are here, and getting THERE is
            still in question. While it seems this idea of “Salvation” from
            all pain and suffering may really be imminent, the idea that its
            going to happen magically and that our actions don’t effect it, is
            as silly as can be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond that, when we do get there, I assume any one of us who may
            enjoy centuries or millennia to come would be pretty eternally
            fulfilled, having recognized the importance of this decade for
            humanity, and having taking action of spending time, resources,
            and attention on the things that mattered most.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me, I am dedicating my entire self towards this mission, as I
            know that in each moment I give myself to the highest good
            possible, I make one small step for mankind, and one giant step
            for the story of myself as a man who is a part of it.

          <p>
            The issue is that the animal world isn’t really an animal
            world—it’s a world of trillions of strands of genetic information,
            each one hell-bent on immortality. Most gene strands don’t last
            very long, and those still on Earth today are the miracle
            outliers, such incredible survival specialists that they’re
            hundreds of millions of years old and counting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Animals are just a hack these outlier genes came up with—
            temporary containers designed to carry the genes and help them
            stay immortal. Genes can’t talk to their animals, so they control
            them by having them run on specialized survival software I call
            the Primitive Mind:

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            The Primitive Mind is a set of coded instructions for how to be a
            successful animal in the animal’s natural habitat. The coder is
            natural selection, which develops the software using a pretty
            simple process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Software that’s good at making its animal pass on its genes stays
            around, and the less successful software is discontinued. Genetic
            mutation is like a bug appearing in the software from time to
            time, and every once in a while, a certain bug makes the software
            better—an accidental software update. It’s a slow way to code, but
            over millions of generations, it gets the job done.

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            The infrequency of these updates means an animal’s software is
            actually optimized for the environment of its ancestors. For most
            animals, this system works fine. Their environment changes so
            slowly that whatever worked a hundred thousand or even a million
            years in the past probably works just about as well in the
            present.
          </p>
          <p>
            But humans are strange animals. A handful of cognitive
            superpowers, like symbolic language, abstract thinking, complex
            social relationships, and long-term planning, have allowed humans
            to take their environment into their own hands in a way no other
            animal can. In the blink of an eye—around 12,000 years or 500
            generations, humans have crafted a totally novel environment for
            themselves called civilization.
          </p>
          <p>
            As great as civilization may be, 500 generations isn’t enough time
            for evolution to take a shit. So now we’re all here living in this
            fancy new habitat, using brain software optimized to our old
            habitat.

            You know how moths seemingly inanely fly toward light and you’re
            not really sure why they do this or what their angle is? It turns
            out that for millions of years, moths have used moonlight as a
            beacon for nocturnal navigation—which works great until a bunch of
            people start turning lights on at night that aren’t the moon. The
            moth’s brain software hasn’t had time to update itself to the new
            situation, and now millions of moths are wasting their lives
            flapping around streetlights.

          <p>
            In a lot of ways, modern humans are like modern moths, running on
            a well-intentioned Primitive Mind that’s constantly
            misinterpreting the weird world we’ve built for ourselves.

            The Higher Mind is the part of you that can think outside itself
            and self-reflect and get wiser with experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike the Primitive Mind, the Higher Mind can look around and see
            the world for what it really is. It can see that you live in an
            advanced civilization and it wants to think and behave
            accordingly. The Primitive Mind and Higher Mind are a funny pair.
            When things are going well, the inside of your head looks like
            this:

            The Higher Mind is large and in charge, while its little software
            pet chases dopamine around, taking care of the eating and sleeping
            and self-gratification. The Primitive Mind, at its core, just
            wants to survive and reproduce and help its offspring
            reproduce—all things the Higher Mind is totally on board with when
            it makes sense. When the Primitive Mind wants you to think and
            behave in a way that doesn’t map onto reality, the Higher Mind
            tries to override the software, keeping you within the “makes
            sense” circle on the right:

            As smart as the Higher Mind may be, it’s not very good at managing
            the Primitive Mind. And when the Primitive Mind gains too much
            control, you might find yourself drifting over to the No Sense
            Zone.

            Like the moth flying toward a streetlight, the human Primitive
            Mind thinks it’s a great decision to eat Skittles. In the ancient
            human world, there was no such thing as processed food, calories
            were hard to come by, and anything with a texture and taste as
            delectable as a Skittle was surely a good thing to eat. Mars,
            Inc., which makes Skittles, knows what makes your Primitive Mind
            tick and is in the business of tricking it. Your Higher Mind knows
            better. If it holds the reins of your mind, it’ll either skip the
            Skittles or have just a few, as a little treat for its primitive
            roommate. But sometimes, there you are, 80 Skittles into your
            binge, hating yourself—because your Primitive Mind has hijacked
            the cockpit.

            This kind of internal disagreement pops up in many parts of life,
            like a constant tug-of-war in our heads—a tug-of-war over our
            thoughts, our emotions, our values, our morals, our judgments, and
            our overall consciousness.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tug-of-war is a spectrum that we can simplify into four basic
            states—or four rungs of a Ladder:
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="side">
          <div class="image">
            <img src="Images/image79.webp" alt="Image79" loading="lazy" class="skeleton-img" />

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Humans are so complicated because we’re all a mixture of both
            “high-rung” and “low-rung” psychology.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Higher Mind is winning the tug-of-war, its staff
            illuminates our minds with clarity, including awareness of the
            Primitive Mind and what it’s up to. The Higher Mind understands
            that primitive pleasures like sex, food, and all-in-good-fun
            tribalism like sports fandom are enjoyable, and often necessary,
            parts of a human life. And like a good pet owner, the Higher Mind
            is more than happy to let the Primitive Mind have its fun.
            Primitive bliss is great, as long as it’s managed by the Higher
            Mind, who makes sure it’s done in moderation, it’s done for the
            right reasons, and no one gets hurt. In short, when we’re up on
            the high rungs, we act like grown-ups.
          </p>
          <p>
            But when something riles up the Primitive Mind, it gets bigger and
            stronger. Its torch—which bears the primal fires of our genes’
            will for survival—grows as well, filling our minds with smoky fog.
            This fog dulls our consciousness, so when we’re most under the
            spell of our Primitive Mind, we don’t even realize it’s happening.
            The Higher Mind, unable to think clearly, begins directing its
            efforts toward supporting whatever the Primitive Mind wants to do,
            whether it makes sense or not. When we slip down to the Ladder’s
            low rungs, we’re short-sighted and small-minded, thinking and
            acting with our pettiest emotions. We’re low on self-awareness and
            high on hypocrisy. We’re our worst selves.
          </p>
          <p>
            We all have our own Ladder struggles. Some of us struggle with
            procrastination, an uncontrollable temper, or an addiction to
            sugar or gambling; others suffer from an irrational fear of
            failure or crippling social anxiety. We all self-defeat in our own
            way—in each case because our Higher Minds lose control of our
            heads and send us flapping our moth wings toward the streetlights.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this book, we’re going to explore a particular group of Ladder
            struggles—those I believe are most relevant to our big question
            about today’s societies: What’s our problem? The first stop on our
            journey will be our own heads, where we’ll use the Ladder to help
            us make sense of a key process: how we form our beliefs.

          <p>Why do we believe what we believe?</p>
          <p>
            Our beliefs make up our perception of reality, drive our behavior,
            and shape our life stories. History happened the way it did
            because of what people believed in the past, and what we believe
            today will write the story of our future. So it seems like an
            important question to ask:
          </p>
          <p>
            How do we actually come to believe the things we end up believing?
          </p>
          <p>To explore this question, let’s create a way to visualize it.</p>
          <p>
            When it comes to our beliefs, let’s imagine the range of views on
            any given topic as an axis we can call the Idea Spectrum.
          </p>
        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            The Idea Spectrum is a simple tool we can use to capture the range
            of what a person might think about any given topic—their beliefs,
            their opinions, their stances.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            For most beliefs, we’re so concerned with where people stand that
            we often forget the most important thing about what someone
            thinks: how they arrived at what they think. This is where the
            Ladder can help. If the Idea Spectrum is a “what you think” axis,
            we can use the Ladder as a “how you think” axis.

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            To understand how our thinking changes depending on where we are
            on the Ladder, we have to ask ourselves: how do the two minds form
            beliefs?
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Higher Mind is aware that humans are often delusional, and it
            wants you to be not delusional. It sees beliefs as the most recent
            draft of a work in progress, and as it lives more and learns more,
            the Higher Mind is always happy to make a revision. Because when
            beliefs are revised, it’s a signal of progress—of becoming less
            ignorant, less foolish, less wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Primitive Mind disagrees. For your genes, what’s important is
            holding beliefs that generate the best kinds of survival behavior
            whether or not those beliefs are actually true. The Primitive
            Mind’s beliefs are usually installed early on in life, often based
            on the prevailing beliefs of your family, peer group, or broader
            community.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Primitive Mind sees those beliefs as a fundamental part of
            your identity and a key to remaining in good standing with the

            So the Higher Mind’s goal is to get to the truth, while the
            Primitive Mind’s goal is confirmation of its existing beliefs.
            These two very different types of intellectual motivation exist
            simultaneously in our heads. This means that our driving
            intellectual motivation—and, in turn, our thinking process—varies
            depending on where we are on the Ladder at any given moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the realm of thinking, then, the Ladder’s four rungs correspond
            to four ways of forming beliefs. When your Higher Mind is running
            the show, you’re up on the top rung, thinking like a Scientist.

            More specifically, the Scientist’s journey from A to B looks

          <p>
            The Scientist’s default position on any topic is “I don’t know.”
            To advance beyond Point A, they have to put in effort, starting
            with the first stage: hypothesis formation.

          </p>
          <p>
            Top-rung thinking forms hypotheses from the bottom up. Rather than
            adopt the beliefs and assumptions of conventional wisdom, you
            puzzle together your own ideas, from scratch. This is a three-part
            process:
          </p>

        <div class="content">

            <b><span>1. Gather information</span></b>
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to puzzle, you need pieces. Each of us is constantly
            flooded with information, and we have severely limited attention
            to allot. In other words, your mind is an exclusive VIP-only club
            with a tough bouncer.
          </p>
          <p>
            But when Scientists want to learn something new, they try to soak
            up a wide variety of information on the topic. The Scientist seeks
            out ideas across the Idea Spectrum, even those that seem likely to
            be wrong—because knowing the range of viewpoints that exist about
            the topic is a key facet of understanding the topic.
          </p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            <b><span>2. Evaluate information</span></b>
          </p>
          <p>
            If gathering info is about quantity, evaluating info is all about
            quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are instances when a thinker has the time and the means to
            collect information and evidence directly—with their own primary
            observations, or by conducting their own studies. But most of the
            info we use to inform ourselves is indirect knowledge: knowledge
            accumulated by others that we import into our minds and adopt as
            our own. Every statistic you come across, everything you read in a
            textbook, everything you learn from parents or teachers,
            everything
          </p>
          <p>
            you see or read in the news or on social media, every tenet of
            conventional wisdom—it’s all indirect knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s why perhaps the most important skill of a skilled thinker
            is knowing when to trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trust, when assigned wisely, is an efficient knowledge-acquisition
            trick. If you can trust a person who actually speaks the truth,
            you can take the knowledge that person worked hard for—either
            through primary research or indirectly, using their own diligent
            trust criteria— and “photocopy” it into your own brain. This
            magical intellectual corner-cutting tool has allowed humanity to
            accumulate so much collective knowledge over the past 10,000 years
            that a species of primates can now understand the origins of the
            universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            But trust assigned wrongly has the opposite effect. When people
            trust information to be true that isn’t, they end up with the
            illusion of knowledge—which is worse than having no knowledge at
            all.
          </p>
          <p>
            So skilled thinkers work hard to master the art of skepticism. A
            thinker who believes everything they hear is too gullible, and
            their beliefs become packed with a jumble of falsehoods,
            misconceptions, and contradictions. Someone who trusts no one is
            overly cynical, even paranoid, and limited to gaining new
            information only by direct experience. Neither of these fosters
            much learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Scientist’s default skepticism position would be somewhere in
            between, with a filter just tight enough to consistently identify
            and weed out bullshit, just open enough to let in the truth. As
            they become familiar with certain information sources—friends,
            media brands, articles, books—the Scientist evaluates the sources
            based on how accurate they’ve proven to be in the past. For
            sources known to be obsessed with accuracy, the Scientist loosens
            up the trust filter. When the Scientist catches a source putting
            out inaccurate or biased ideas, they tighten up the filter and
            take future information with a grain of salt.

            The gathering and evaluating phases rely heavily on the learnings
            of others, but for the Scientist, the final puzzle is mostly a
            work of independent reasoning. When it’s time to form an opinion,
            their head becomes a wide-open creative laboratory.

            Scientists, so rigid about their high-up position on the vertical
            How You Think axis, start out totally agnostic about their
            horizontal position on the What You Think axis. Early on in the
            puzzling process, they treat the Idea Spectrum like a skating
            rink, happily gliding back and forth as they explore different
            possible viewpoints.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the gathering and evaluating processes continue, the Scientist
            grows more confident in their puzzling. Eventually, they begin to
            settle on a portion of the Idea Spectrum where they suspect the
            truth may lie. Their puzzle is finally taking shape—they have
            begun to form a hypothesis.

            right about an opinion they’ve never had to defend—an opinion that
            has never stepped into the ring. Scientists know that an untested
            belief is only a hypothesis—a boxer with potential, but not a
            champion of anything. So the Scientist starts expressing the idea
            publicly, in person and online. It’s time to see if the little guy
            can box.

            In the world of ideas, boxing opponents come in the form of
            dissent. When the Scientist starts throwing ideas out into the
            world, the punches pour in. Biased reasoning, oversimplification,
            logical fallacies, and questionable statistics are the weak spots
            that feisty dissenters look for, and every effective blow landed
            on the hypothesis helps the Scientist improve their ideas. This is
            why Scientists actively seek out dissent. As organizational
            psychologist Adam Grant puts it in his book Think Again:
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve noticed a paradox in great scientists and superforecasters:
            the reason they’re so comfortable being wrong is that they’re
            terrified of being wrong. What sets them apart is the time
            horizon. They’re determined to reach the correct answer in the
            long run, and they know that means they have to be open to
            stumbling, backtracking, and rerouting in the short run. They shun
            rose-colored glasses in favor of a sturdy mirror. The more boxing
            matches the Scientist puts their hypothesis through, the more
            they’re able to explore the edges of their conclusions and tweak
            their ideas into crisper and more confident beliefs.
          </p>
          <p>
            With some serious testing and a bunch of refinements under their
            belt, the Scientist may begin to feel that they have arrived at
            Point B: knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s a long road to knowledge for the Scientist because truth is
            hard. It’s why Scientists say “I don’t know” so often. It’s why,
            even after getting to Point B in the learning process, the
            Scientist applies a little asterisk, knowing that all beliefs are
            subject to being proven wrong by changing times or new evidence.
            Thinking like a Scientist isn’t about knowing a lot, it’s about
            being aware of what you do and don’t know— about staying close to
            this dotted line as you learn:

          <p>
            When you’re thinking like a Scientist—self-aware, free of bias,
            unattached to any particular ideas, motivated entirely by truth
            and continually willing to revise your beliefs—your brain is a
            hyper- efficient learning machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the thing is—it’s hard to think like a Scientist, and most of
            us are bad at it most of the time. When your Primitive Mind wakes
            up and enters the scene, it’s very easy to drift down to the
            second rung of our Ladder—a place where your thinking is caught up
            in the tug-of-war.

            Most real-life sports fans want the games they watch to be played

            yield a certain outcome. They’re not just watching the
            game—they’re rooting. When your Primitive Mind infiltrates your
            reasoning process, you start thinking the same way. You still
            believe you’re starting at Point A, and you still want Point B to
            be the truth. But you’re not exactly objective about it.

            Weird things happen to your thinking when the drive for truth is
            infected by some ulterior motive. Psychologists call it “motivated
            reasoning.” I like to think of it as Reasoning While Motivated—the
            thinking equivalent of drunk driving. As the 6th century Chinese
            Zen master Seng-ts’an explains: If you want the truth to stand
            clear before you, never be for or against. The struggle between
            “for” and “against” is the mind’s worst disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you’re thinking like a Sports Fan, Seng-ts’an and his
            apostrophe and his hyphen are all mad at you, because they know
            what they’re about to see—the Scientist’s rigorous thinking
            process corrupted by the truth-seeker’s most treacherous obstacle:
            Confirmation bias.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confirmation bias is the invisible hand of the Primitive Mind that
            tries to push you toward confirming your existing beliefs and pull
            you away from changing your mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            You still gather information, but you may cherry-pick sources that
            seem to support your ideas. With the Primitive Mind affecting your
            emotions, it just feels good to have your views confirmed, while
            hearing dissent feels irritating. You still evaluate information,
            but instead of defaulting to the trust filter’s middle setting,
            you find yourself flip-flopping on either side of it, depending
            less on the proven track record of the source than on how much the
            source seems to agree with you:
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="side">

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            So the puzzle pieces collected in the Sports Fan’s head are skewed
            toward confirming a certain belief, and this is then compounded by
            a corrupted puzzling process. Compelling dissent that does make it
            into a Sports Fan’s head is often forgotten about and left out of
            the final puzzle.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it’s time to test the hypothesis, the Sports Fan’s bias again
            rears its head. If you were thinking like a Scientist, you’d feel
            very little attachment to your hypothesis. But now you watch your
            little machine box as a fan, wearing its jersey. It’s Your Guy in
            the ring. And if it wins an argument, you might even catch
            yourself thinking, “We won!”
          </p>

            When a good punch is landed on your hypothesis, you’re likely to
            see it as a cheap shot or a lucky swing or something else that’s
            not really legit. And when your hypothesis lands a punch, you may
            have a tendency to overrate the magnitude of the blow or the high
            level of skill it involved.

            Being biased skews your assessment of other people’s thinking too.
            You believe you’re unbiased, so someone actually being neutral
            appears to you to be biased in the other direction, while someone
            who shares your bias appears to be neutral. As this process wears
            on, it’s no surprise that the Sports Fan often ends up just where
            they were hoping to—at their preferred Point B.

            On this second rung of the Ladder, the hyper-optimized learning
            machine that is the Scientist’s brain has become hampered by a
            corrupting motivation. But despite learning less than the
            Scientist, the Sports Fan usually feels a little more confident
            about their beliefs.

            Sports Fans are stubborn, but they’re not hopeless. The Higher
            Mind is still a strong presence in their head, and if dissenting
            evidence is strong enough, the Sports Fan will grudgingly change
            their mind. Underneath all the haze of cognitive bias, Sports Fans
            still care most about finding the truth.

            Drift down any further, though, and you cross the Ladder midpoint
            and become a different kind of thinker entirely. Down on the low
            rungs, the Primitive Mind has the edge in the tug-of-war. Whether
            you’ll admit it or not (you won’t), the desire to feel right, and
            appear right, has overcome your desire to be right. And when some
            other motivation surpasses your drive for truth, you leave the
            world of intellectual integrity and enter a new place.

            An Attorney and a Sports Fan have things in common. They’re both
            conflicted between the intellectual values of truth and
            confirmation. The critical difference is which value, deep down,
            they hold more sacred. A Sports Fan wants to win, but when pushed,
            cares most about truth. But it’s an Attorney’s job to win, and
            nothing can alter their allegiance.

            When you’re thinking like an Attorney, you don’t start at Point A
            at all. You start at Point B. The client is not guilty. Now let’s
            figure out why.
          </p>

            From there you’ll go through your due diligence, cherry-picking
            evidence and piecing together an argument that leads right where
            you want it to.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn’t a criticism of real-world attorneys. In an actual
            courtroom, the attorney’s way of thinking makes sense—because each
            attorney’s case is only half of what will be presented to the
            jury. Real-world attorneys know that the best way for the system
            to yield truth is for them to make the best possible case for one
            side of the story. But on our Ladder, the cognitive Attorney’s
            head is like a courtroom with only one side represented—in other
            words, a corrupt courtroom where the ruling is predetermined.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Attorney treats their preferred beliefs not like an experiment
            that can be revised, or even a favorite sports team, but like a
            client. Motivated reasoning becomes obligated reasoning, and the
            gathering, evaluating, and puzzling processes function like law
            associates whose only job is to help build the case for Point B.
          </p>
          <p>
            If someone really wants to believe something—that the Earth is
            flat, that 9/11 was orchestrated by Americans, that the CIA is
            after them— the human brain will find a way to make that belief
            seem perfectly clear and irrefutable. For the Attorney, the
            hypothesis formation stage is really a belief-strengthening
            process. They inevitably end up with the same viewpoints they
            started with, now beefed up with a refreshed set of facts and
            arguments that remind them just how right they are.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the hypothesis testing phase, the Attorney’s refusal to
            genuinely listen to a dissenter, combined with a bag of logical
            fallacy tricks and their strong sense of conviction, ensures that
            they’re an absolutely infuriating person to argue with. The
            Attorney’s opponents will feel like they’re arguing with a brick
            wall, and by the end, it’ll be clear that nothing they could have
            said—nothing whatsoever—would have made the Attorney say, “Hmm
            that’s a good point. I need to think about that. Maybe I’m wrong.”

            The result of thinking like an Attorney is that your brain’s
            incredible ability to learn new things is mostly shut down. Even
            worse, your determination to confirm your existing beliefs leaves
            you confident about a bunch of things that aren’t true. Your
            efforts only make you more delusional. If there’s anything you can
            say about Attorney thinking, it’s that it at least acknowledges
            the concept of the knowledge-building process. When you’re
            thinking like an Attorney, you’re inconvincible, but you’re not
            that big an internal shift away from high-rung thinking. From
            somewhere in the periphery of your mind, the voice of the Higher
            Mind still carries some weight. And if you can learn to listen to
            it and value it, maybe things can change.
          </p>
          <p>
            But sometimes, there are beliefs that your Primitive Mind holds so
            dear that your Higher Mind has no influence at all over how you
            think about them. When dealing with these topics, ideas and people
            feel inseparable and changing your mind feels like an existential
            threat. You’re on the bottom rung.

          <p>
            And every day when you look at your baby, you can’t believe how

            ideas aren’t rugged experiments to be kicked around, they’re
            fragile, precious babies to be adored and protected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like no parent has to research whether their baby is lovable,
            the Zealot doesn’t have to go from A to B to know their viewpoints
            are correct—they just know they are. With 100% conviction.
          </p>

            Likewise with skepticism. If someone told you your actual baby was
            super cute, you wouldn’t assess their credibility, you’d be in
            automatic full agreement. And if someone told you your baby was
            hideous, you wouldn’t consider their opinion, you’d just think
            they were a terrible person.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s why the Zealot’s flip-flop goes from one extreme to the
            other, with no in between.

            When Zealots argue, things can quickly get heated, because for
            someone who identifies with their ideas, a challenge to those
            ideas feels like an insult. It feels personally invalidating. A
            punch landed on a Zealot’s idea is a punch landed on their baby.

            When the Primitive Mind is overactive in our heads, it turns us

            simple world, full of crisp lines and black-and-white
            distinctions. When you’re thinking like a Zealot, you end up in a
            totally alternative reality, feeling like you’re an omniscient

            The four thinking rungs are all distinct, but they fall into two
            broad categories: high-rung thinking (Scientist and Sports Fan)
            and low-rung thinking (Attorney and Zealot).
          </p>
          <p>
            High-rung thinking is independent thinking, leaving you free to
            revise your ideas or even discard them altogether. But when
            there’s no amount of evidence that will change your mind about
            something, it means that idea is your boss. On the low rungs,
            you’re working to dutifully serve your ideas, not the other way
            around.
          </p>
          <p>
            High-rung thinking is productive thinking. The humility of the
            high-rung mindset makes your mind a permeable filter that absorbs
            life experience and converts it into knowledge and wisdom. On the
            other hand, the arrogance of low-rung thinking makes your mind a
            rubber shell that life experience bounces off of. One begets
            learning, the other ignorance.

          <p>
            We all spend time on the low rungs, and when we’re thinking this
            way, we don’t realize we’re doing it. We believe our conviction
            has been hard-earned. We believe our viewpoints are original and
            based on knowledge. Because as the Primitive Mind’s influence
            grows in our heads, so does the fog that clouds our consciousness.
            This is how low-rung thinking persists.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each of us is a work in progress. We’ll never rid our lives of
            low-rung thinking, but the more we evolve psychologically, the
            more time we spend thinking from the high rungs and the less time
            we spend down below. Improving this ratio is a good intellectual
            goal for all of us.

          <p>
            But this is just the beginning of our journey. Because individual
            thinking is the center of a much larger picture. We're social
            creatures, and as with most things, the way we think is often
            intertwined with the people we surround ourselves with.

            own values and minimize friction? Or do we surround ourselves with
            a range of conflicting cultures to put some pressure on our inner
            minds to learn and grow? Whether you consciously realize it or
            not, you’re making these decisions all the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Culture can encompass many aspects of interaction. A group of
            friends, for example, has a way they do birthdays, a way they do
            emojis, a way they do talking behind each other’s backs, a way
            they do conflict, and so on. For our purposes, we’ll again limit
            our discussion to how all this pertains to thinking, or a group’s
            intellectual culture—“how we do things here” as it relates to the
            expression of ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the same way the two aspects of your mind compete for control
            over how you think, a similar struggle happens on a larger scale
            over how the group thinks. Higher Minds can band together with
            other Higher Minds and form a kind of coalition, and a group’s
            collective Primitive Minds can do the same thing. One coalition
            gaining control over the culture is like home-field advantage in
            sports—a hard one for the “away team” to overcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s first explore what it looks like when the Higher Minds have
            the reins of a group’s intellectual culture.

          <p>
            Most of us know the term “Echo Chamber,” and we’ll get to that in
            a minute—but we sorely lack a term for the opposite of an Echo
            Chamber. When the rules of a group’s intellectual culture mirror
            the values of high-rung thinking, the group is what I call an Idea
            Lab.
          </p>
          <p>
            An Idea Lab is an environment of collaborative high-rung thinkers.
            People in an Idea Lab see one another as experimenters and their
            ideas as experiments. Idea Labs value independent thinking and
            viewpoint diversity. This combination leads to the richest and
            most interesting conversations and maximizes the scope of group
            discussions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Idea Labs place a high regard on humility, and saying “I don’t
            know” usually wins trust and respect. When someone who often says
            “I don’t know” does express conviction about a viewpoint, it
            really means something, and others will take it to heart without
            too much skepticism needed—which saves the listener time and
            effort. Likewise, unearned conviction is a major no-no in an Idea
            Lab. So someone with a reputation for bias or arrogance or
            dishonesty will be met with a high degree of skepticism, no matter
            how much conviction they express.
          </p>
          <p>
            Idea Labs also love arguments. Ideas in an Idea Lab are treated
            like hypotheses, which means people are always looking for
            opportunities to test what they’ve been thinking about. Idea Labs
            are the perfect boxing ring for that testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes high-rung thinkers engage in debate, defending an idea,
            strenuously arguing for its validity.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Other times, they’ll engage in dialectic, joining the dissenter in
            examining their idea.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="side">

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            They may even try flipping sides and playing devil’s advocate,
            debating against someone who agrees with them in order to see
            their idea through another lens.
          </p>
        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            People in an Idea Lab don’t usually take arguments personally
            because Idea Lab culture is built around the core notion that
            people and ideas are separate things. People are meant to be
            respected, ideas are meant to be batted around and picked apart.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps most importantly, an Idea Lab helps its members stay high
            up on the Ladder. No one thinks like pure top-rung Scientists all
            the time. More often, after a brief stint on the top rung during
            an especially lucid and humble period, we start to like the new
            epiphanies we gleaned up there a little too much, and we quickly
            drop down to the Sports Fan rung. And that’s okay. It might even
            be optimal to be a little over-confident in our intellectual
            lives. Rooting for our ideas—a new philosophy, a new lifestyle
            choice, a new business strategy— allows us to really give them a
            try, somewhat liberated from the constant “but are we really sure
            about this?” nag from the Higher Mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sports Fan rung alone isn’t a problem. The problem is that
            inviting some bias into the equation is a bit like closing your
            eyes for just another minute after you’ve shut your alarm off for
            good—it’s riskier than it feels. Getting a little attached to an
            idea is a small step away from drifting unconsciously into
            Inconvincible Land and the oblivion of the rungs down below. We’re
            pre-programmed to be low- rung thinkers, so our intellects are
            always fighting against gravity.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why Idea Lab culture is so important. It’s a support
            network for flawed thinkers to help each other stay up on the high
            rungs.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            The social pressure helps. If high-rung thinking is what all the
            cool kids are doing, you’re more likely to think that way.
          </p>
          <p>
            And the intellectual pressure helps. In an Idea Lab—where people
            don’t hesitate to tell you when you’re wrong or biased or
            hypocritical or gullible—humility and self-awareness are inflicted
            upon you. Whenever you get a little too overconfident, Idea Lab
            culture pulls you back to an honest level of conviction.
          </p>
          <p>
            All these forces combine to make an Idea Lab a big magnet on top
            of the Ladder that pulls upward on the psyches of people immersed
            in it.
          </p>

            But what happens when a group’s Primitive Minds can run things
            their way?

            An Echo Chamber is what happens when a group’s intellectual
            culture slips down to the low rungs: collaborative low-rung
            thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Idea Labs are cultures of critical thinking and debate, Echo
            Chambers are cultures of groupthink and conformity. Because while
            Idea Labs are devoted to a kind of thinking, Echo Chambers are
            devoted to a set of beliefs the culture deems to be sacred.
          </p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            A culture that treats ideas like sacred objects incentivizes
            entirely different behavior than the Idea Lab. In an Echo Chamber,
            falling in line with the rest of the group is socially rewarded.
            It’s a common activity to talk about how obviously correct the
            sacred ideas are—it’s how you express your allegiance to the
            community and prove your own intellectual and moral worth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Humility is looked down upon in an Echo Chamber, where saying “I
            don’t know” just makes you sound ignorant and changing your mind
            makes you seem wishy-washy. And conviction, used sparingly in an
            Idea Lab, is social currency in an Echo Chamber. The more
            conviction you speak with, the more knowledgeable, intelligent,
            and righteous you seem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Idea Labs can simultaneously respect a person and disrespect the
            person’s ideas. But Echo Chambers equate a person’s ideas with
            their identity, so respecting a person and respecting their ideas
            are one and the same. Disagreeing with someone in an Echo Chamber
            is seen not as intellectual exploration but as rudeness, making an
            argument about ideas indistinguishable from a fight.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="side">

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            This moral component provides Echo Chambers with a powerful tool
            for cultural law enforcement: taboo. Those who challenge the
            sacred ideas are seen not just as wrong but as bad people. As
            such, violators are slapped with the social fines of status
            reduction or reputation damage, the social jail time of ostracism,
            and even the social death penalty of permanent excommunication.
            Express the wrong opinion on God, abortion, patriotism,
            immigration, race, or capitalism in the wrong group and you may be
            met with an explosive negative reaction. Echo Chambers are places
            where you must watch what you say.
          </p>
          <p>
            An Echo Chamber can be the product of a bunch of people who all
            hold certain ideas to be sacred. Other times, it can be the
            product of one or a few “intellectual bullies” who everyone else
            is scared to defy. Even in the smallest group—a married couple,
            say—if one person knows that it’s never worth the fight to
            challenge their spouse’s strongly held viewpoints, the spouse is
            effectively imposing Echo Chamber culture on the marriage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Intellectual cultures have a major impact on the individuals
            within them. While Idea Lab culture encourages intellectual and
            moral growth, Echo Chamber culture discourages new ideas, curbs
            intellectual innovation, and removes knowledge-acquisition tools
            like debate—all of which repress growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spending too much time in an Echo Chamber makes people feel less
            humble and more sure of themselves, all while limiting actual
            learning and causing thinking skills to atrophy.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a broader sense, both primitive-mindedness and high- mindedness
            tend to be contagious. While Idea Lab culture is a support group
            that helps keep people’s minds up on the high rungs, Echo Chamber
            culture pumps out Primitive Mind pheromones and exerts a general
            downward pull on the psyches of its members.

            Given the obvious benefits of Idea Lab culture, it’s odd that we
            ever go for the alternative. We eat Skittles because our Primitive
            Minds are programmed to want sugary, calorie-dense food. But why
            do our Primitive Minds want us to build Echo Chambers?

            Not long after cells started joining together to form animals,
            some of the animals discovered that they could go up another level
            of emergence and form even bigger giants made up of multiple
            animals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes, when we see animals cooperating, it seems like they’re
            being considerate—but that’s missing the bigger picture. The
            emergence picture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take ants and spiders. Ants are furiously loyal. They always put
            the team first. The ants I’ve gotten to know in my life have a
            long list of bad personal qualities, but “individual selfishness”
            isn’t one of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, two rival spiders will compete with each other
            ruthlessly, both entirely self-interested.

          <p>So what’s the deal? Are ants nicer than spiders?</p>
          <p>
            No. It’s just that spiders stop doing the emergence thing at the
            individual organism level, while ants go up a level higher—to the
            ant colony.

            world.

          <p>
            If we look at how ant colonies treat other ant colonies, it’s a
            lot like the way one spider treats another.

            Individual ants in a colony are kind of like the cells that make up your body, which cooperate with each
            other not because they’re nice, but because they’re part of a bigger life form.
          </p>
          <p>Humans do emergence too—and like all things human, it’s complicated.

            First, in the same way we bounce up and down the Ladder, we’re all
            over the place on the Emergence Tower.</p>
          <p>You might wake up in the morning with your psyche firmly on the
            bottom of the tower, feeling like a lone individual. You head to work,
            where you brainstorm a project with five other people, becoming part
            of a six-person thinking machine. After work you join a political
            protest outside, losing your sense of self in the exhilaration of being a
            tiny piece of a thousand-person megaphone. Depending on the

            situation, we can act like spiders or ants, and everything in between.
            It’s as if there’s an elevator in the Emergence Tower, and our minds
            take regular trips up and down.</p>
          <p>Second, humans form weird giants. There are all kinds of ways
            animal species “glue” together into higher-emergence giants. Simple
            creatures like ants and bees achieve cooperation on a mass scale,

            which comes at the expense of individual autonomy. Complex animals
            like wolves, lions, and dolphins are more individually independent, but

            they also have smaller families, which typically limits the size of the
            “giant” they can make.</p>
          <p>Early humans were similar to other complex animals—limited to
            small, tightly knit tribes. But at some point along the way, they figured
            out how to hack the system. By uniting through shared beliefs, shared
            culture, shared values, or shared interests, they shattered the previous
            ceiling on giant size and achieved something other complex animals

            couldn’t: mass cooperation.</p>
          <p>When you take the already impressive power of human cognition

            and combine it with the capability of mass cooperation, you have a
            species with superpowers.</p>
          <p>But here we come back to our Ladder, because the human Higher
            Mind and Primitive Mind each have their own way of doing
            emergence. Idea Labs and Echo Chambers are more than just group
            cultures—they’re two very different ways to build a human giant.</p>

            But by communicating with one another, a group of neurons can move upward on the Emergence Tower and combine
            into a single thinking system that’s far more powerful than the sum of its parts: the brain.

            A parallel phenomenon happens a few floors up the tower, on the human level. A bunch of people together, but
            not communicating, is just a bunch of individual brains in the same place. Language is important because it
            allows individual brains to connect, like neurons, to form a larger thinking system: a communal brain.

            In his book The Righteous Mind, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt talks about how group communal brains
            work:
          </p>
          <p>
            If you put individuals together in the right way, such that some
            individuals can use their reasoning powers to disconfirm the
            claims of others... you can create a group that ends up
            producing good reasoning as an emergent property of the
            social system. This is why it’s so important to have intellectual
            and ideological diversity within any group or institution whose
            goal is to find truth.
          </p>
          <p>This is the magic of Idea Lab culture. While individual thinking
            suffers from bias, a diversity of biases helps the communal brain
            reduce blind spots. In a culture where changing your mind is
            encouraged, new findings spread quickly through the system, and all it
            takes is one member discovering a falsehood for the whole group to
            reject it. When disagreement is encouraged, new ideas can be tested
            as they’re being formed, in real-time, combining the knowledge-
            building efforts of each person into a single, dynamic process.</p>
          <p>The result is a multi-mind thinking system that’s superior to any of
            its individual members at learning new things and separating truth
            from fiction. Let’s call this thinking system a genie.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="side">
          <div class="image">
            <img src="Images/image128.webp" alt="Image128" loading="lazy" class="skeleton-img" />

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Because genies convert disagreement into higher-level
            collaboration, there’s nothing stopping them from endlessly scaling up.
            For example, a research institution is an official Idea Lab, where
            practices like peer review generate a hyper-efficient genie. But then,
            research centers from different universities or even different
            countries can criticize or build upon each other’s findings, allowing
            many genies to combine forces into a global supergenie.
          </p>
          <p>
            None of this collaboration comes at the expense of the individual.
            Quite the opposite, genies flourish when its members are
            independent thinkers. So people in a genie get the best of all
            emergence worlds: they can simultaneously thrive as free individuals
            and as smaller pieces of a larger system.
          </p>
          <p>This is the Higher Mind’s way of building giants. When Primitive
            Minds take the reins, we end up with an entirely different kind of
            beast.</p>

            So Giovanni got on his horse and spent four months traveling 3,000 miles to Mongolia—a place almost no
            Europeans had ever set foot (Marco Polo wouldn’t begin his famous voyage for another 26 years).

            An Echo Chamber can be the product of a bunch of people who all
            hold certain ideas to be sacred. Other times, it can be the
            product of one or a few “intellectual bullies” who everyone else
            is scared to defy. Even in the smallest group—a married couple,
            say—if one person knows that it’s never worth the fight to
            challenge their spouse’s strongly held viewpoints, the spouse is
            effectively imposing Echo Chamber culture on the marriage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Somehow Giovanni survived the whole ordeal and, after spending four months with Mongols, made his way back
            to Europe. It turns out the Mongols were not overhyped. Giovanni wrote a book about how they lived and how
            they conducted their conquests.

          </p>
          <p>
            Spending too much time in an Echo Chamber makes people feel less
            humble and more sure of themselves, all while limiting actual
            learning and causing thinking skills to atrophy.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Giovanni, the Mongol army was organized using a decimal system that worked like this:

          <p>
            Giovanni wrote about the incredibly strict discipline Mongol rulers imposed on their army:
          </p>
          <p>When they join battle against any other nation, unless they do
            all consent to retreat, every man who deserts is put to death.
            And if one or two, or more, of ten proceed manfully to the
            battle, but the residue of those ten draw back and follow not
            the company, they are in like matter slain. Also, if one among
            ten or more be taken, their fellows, if they fail to rescue them,
            are punished with death.</p>
          <p>Pretty happy I’m not in the Mongol army. But I’m even happier to
            not be in the path of the Mongol army. Historian J. J. Saunders writes:</p>
          <p>[Genghis] was adept at psychological warfare of the most
            horrific kind. He deliberately set out to create a reputation for

            ferocious terror in the expectation (often realized) of
            frightening whole nations into surrendering without resistance.
            There is something indescribably revolting in the cold savagery
            with which the Mongols carried out their massacres. The
            inhabitants of a doomed town were obliged to assemble in a
            plain outside the walls, and each Mongol trooper, armed with a
            battle-axe, was told to kill so many people, ten, twenty, or fifty.
            [...] A few days after the massacre, troops were sent back into
            the ruined city to search for any poor wretches who might be
            hiding in holes or cellars; these were dragged out and slain.</p>
          <p>How many people can you name who lived in the 1200s? Like two,
            right? But you know about Genghis Khan. Everybody knows about
            Genghis Khan. Because Genghis Khan built one of the biggest, baddest
            golems in human history.</p>
          <p>In mythology, a golem is a big dumb-looking monster, which makes
            it a perfect representation of the low-rung giant.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>If the genie is the product of human collaboration, the golem is the
            emergent property of human obedience. Golems are what happen
            when humans act like ants.</p>
          <p>Ant behavior has two components: strict conformity within the
            colony and total ruthlessness when dealing with other colonies.</p>
          <p>On the internal conformity side, Mongol leaders viewed their army
            like a machine. If a member of a 10-man unit deserted, they saw that
            unit as a defective part in the machine that couldn’t police itself, so
            they tossed it out by killing the whole unit. This may sound insane to
            us, but if your only goal is to create the perfect golem, this is simply like
            cutting out a cancerous tumor before it spreads.</p>
          <p>On the external ruthlessness side, the Mongol army had clear rules
            for settled societies that lay in its path: you’re with us or against us. If
            you immediately surrender, you’ll be allowed to join our forces and
            live. If you resist, we will destroy you, down to every man, woman, and
            child.</p>
          <p>I use the Mongols as an example because they’re the extreme
            version of a human golem. But golems are everywhere. When a group
            of people exhibits a combination of strict conformity internally and an
            Us vs. Them mindset externally—militaries marching in unison,
            activists chanting a slogan, citizens raising a fist or saluting en masse,
            or just a group of people being super Echo-Chamber-y—that’s a group
            of people in golem mode.</p>
          <p>The human cognitive weaknesses a genie tries to mitigate are the
            golem’s strengths. Confirmation bias tricks like cherry-picking,
            motivated skepticism, and motivated reasoning benefit hugely from
            economies of scale, as the snappiest and most convincing articulations
            of the sacred ideas spread quickly through the system. Individual
            biases, all pointing in the same direction in an Echo Chamber, scale up
            to make the golem’s ultra-biased macro-mind. And while individual
            minds inside a golem may have doubts about the sacred ideas, the
            social pressure of Echo Chamber culture keeps the giant as a whole
            steadfast in its beliefs. If the genie is the ultimate Scientist, the golem
            is the ultimate Zealot—a giant that’s totally certain of itself, totally

            unable to learn or change its mind, and worse at thinking than the
            average human.</p>
          <p>But golems aren’t made to be good at thinking or finding the truth.
            The golem’s specialty is brute strength. It’s a group’s way of turning
            itself into a big scary monster.</p>
          <p>We talked about how genies can seamlessly combine their forces
            with other genies to create supergenies. Golems scale up too, but in a
            very different way—based on conflict. Golems don’t just prefer the Us
            vs. Them mindset, they rely on it. The presence of a rival golem is a
            critical part of what holds them together. The way golems combine
            forces is by sharing a common enemy. If a group of golems vanquishes
            their common enemy, the alliance will often fracture into smaller rival
            golems to maintain the Us vs. Them structure.</p>
          <p>Let’s try to jam all of this into a chart:</p>

          <p>On the high rungs, individuals can thrive and grow, and human
            intelligence and knowledge can scale up exponentially. The low rungs
            squash individuality, breed delusion, and sacrifice group intelligence in
            favor of brute strength and large-scale conflict.</p>
          <p>Which brings us back to the same question: given that the high
            rungs are so awesome, why are we so inclined to be down on the crappy
            low rungs?</p>
          <p>It’s what our Primitive Minds are programmed to do because it was
            the best way to survive in our distant past. Low-rung thinking, low-
            rung culture, and low-rung giant-building are all ancient survival

            behavior—behavior that was necessary a long time ago but today
            seems a lot like moths flying toward streetlights.</p>
          <p>When I look out at the world today, I see a rising epidemic of low-
            rung thinking and behavior. Too many of the Ladder struggles that
            exist in our heads, in our communities, in our political parties, and in
            our societies are slipping in the wrong direction.</p>
          <p>In the introduction, I compared the path of

            our species to a big organism trudging its way up a great mountain
            ridge, with steep cliffs on either side. I see the high rungs as our source
            of stability and positive progress, and low-rungs as the force
            pushing us toward those cliffs.</p>
          <p>To give ourselves the best chance to stay up on that ridge, we need
            to see low-rung psychology where it resides and figure out how to
            outsmart it.</p>

            At the top-middle of the Media Matrix is media’s North Star. Here you have media sources that are rigorous
            about both accuracy and neutrality, trying their best to present the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
            the truth—along with acknowledging when they don’t know what the truth is. This is the realm of high-rung

            to the upper corners, you have brands with a serious bias—careful about accuracy but not about neutrality.
            Everything they report is carefully cherry-picked.</p>
          <p>As you move down in the Media Matrix, accuracy diminishes as a core value in favor of profit,
            entertainment, a political agenda, or something else. A news source down here is a steadfast ally to its
            partisan audience, and it stays current with the latest talking points in Political Disney World, even if
            that means twisting stories, using misleading statistics, pulling quotes out of context, treating rumors as

            isn’t one of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then there was the end of the Fairness Doctrine. In 1949, the FCC
            (the U.S. Federal Communications Commission) established the
            Fairness Doctrine, which required anyone who held a broadcast
            license to present “controversial issues of public importance” in a “fair

            and balanced” manner, giving airtime to “contrasting viewpoints.” In
            1987, in the face of arguments that the Fairness Doctrine was in direct

            conflict with the First Amendment’s freedom of the press clause, it was repealed.
          </p>
          <p>The removal of the Fairness Doctrine was soon followed by a sharp

            rise in overtly partisan media. Conservative talk radio exploded onto
            the scene in the late 1980s, most notably with The Rush Limbaugh
            Show, which debuted to a national audience in 1988 and made
            Limbaugh the country’s most syndicated radio host by 1991. In
            1996, Fox News and MSNBC were born. Rather than broadcasting to
            all of America, these new media channels could narrowcast to a
            specific subset of the country.</p>
          <p>In college in 2004, I attended a live interview with Ted Koppel, the
            anchor of ABC’s late-night news show Nightline. I remember the host
            commenting that Koppel was famously secretive about his own
            political leanings. This was the standard for prominent anchors in the
            past, but by the end of the 1990s, a huge portion of Americans were
            getting their news from people whose political leaning was supremely
            out on the table.</p>
          <p>While these changes were happening, the internet sprung into our
            lives, and with it, sites like The Drudge Report (1995), Slate (1996),
            The Huffington Post (2005), and Breitbart (2007), along with a trillion
            political blogs and YouTube channels. The internet took narrowcasting
            up into a new gear: full-fledged tribal media.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Fox News and conservative radio continued to grow in
            size and influence, generating an insular right-wing information

            bubble that persists today. This was countered with a new genre of
            TV news on the Left—political comedy shows. The Daily Show began in
            1996 and became a multi-decade sensation by serving as—depending
            on who you ask—either the voice of reason and sanity in the face of
            growing right-wing madness, or a show where elitist progressives
            would cackle as Jon Stewart relentlessly mocked their political out-
            group. The Daily Show was followed by a slew of similar “look at how
            awful the Right is” comedy/news shows, hosted by Daily Show alums
            like Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, and Samantha Bee.</p>
          <p>Narrowcast media caters to homogeneous audiences, which
            decreases the incentive to worry about neutrality and heightens the
            incentive to provide viewpoint confirmation. Rather than tell people
            which candidate is likely to win the next election like the old days,
            narrowcast media reaps huge rewards for telling people why their

            favorite candidate ought to win. With little risk of reputation
            damage for biased coverage, narrowcast media can continually bash
            one side while giving the other side a free pass and end up with a more
            loyal audience for it. If broadcast media functions like a top-rung
            Scientist, narrowcast media functions like a third-rung Attorney.
            Because when the environment changes, so does behavior.</p>

            Many businesses have learned that a great way to make money is to
            sell directly to the simple, predictable Primitive Mind. To sell food to
            the Higher Mind, you have to worry about quality and nutrition, which
            is expensive and hard. Instead, you can sell Skittles to the Primitive
            Mind, who mistakes them for nutritious food.

          <p>If professional news coverage is nutritious food, political junk food
            looks like this(all actual headlines):</p>
          <p>
            The confirmation promised by these kinds of headlines looks as
            delectable to the Primitive Mind as the sweet sustenance promised by
            a Skittles wrapper. Political junk food isn’t geared toward learning. The
            headlines tell you from the get-go which side will win and which side
            will lose. It combines three of the Primitive Mind’s favorite things:
            viewpoint/identity confirmation, out-group bashing, and gossip.
          </p>
          <p>The explosion of the political junk food market has dragged many
            American minds downward into Political Disney World, the land of
            good guys, bad guys, and simple storylines—which in turn has
            continually raised the demand for junk food.</p>
          <p>The further this cycle goes, the harder it is to reverse. Media brands
            that offer up one-sided tribal junk food end up alienating high-rung
            minds, which makes the brands that much more dependent on the
            junk-food-loving low-rung audience. And tens of millions of Americans
            end up with political diabetes.</p>
          <p>As the media junk food industry has grown and matured, it has
            increasingly immersed its audience in a new, hideous genre of

          <p><b><span>Political reality TV</span></b></p>
        </h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Broadcast TV news aimed to be a show about reality. Narrowcast
            news tries to be a reality show. Big difference.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reality is interesting sometimes. Reality shows are interesting all
            the time. And what’s the reality TV producer’s best trick? Drama and
            negativity. Would anyone watch The Real Housewives of Beverly
            Hills if the characters got along most of the time? Of course not. That’s
            why every five minutes of the show includes a conflict of some kind.
          </p>
          <p>As soon as you realize that news media is also entertainment media, the constant coverage of conflict and
            drama makes perfect sense. In the U.S., many of us are addicted to a trashy reality show I call The Real
            Politicians of Washington D.C.</p>
          <p>The cast changes from year to year, but the formula is the same:
            there are whole teams of heroes and villains, lots of ongoing
            storylines, and endless conflict. It’s a perfect vehicle for a dramatic,
            super-addictive soap opera.
          </p>
          <p>It’s not that these heavily featured politicians or the played-up
            storylines are unimportant. It’s that we receive a
            totally skewed depiction of the full set of relevant political issues. The
            issues that make headlines day in and day out are usually
            overrepresented, while lots of other important political stories—like
            the bills being approved each week by the 50 House and Senate
            committees—are woefully underreported.</p>
          <p>I recently had a chance to talk with a U.S. representative
            named Derek Kilmer. Kilmer is the former head of a major
            congressional coalition of moderate Democrats with 99 members.
            He’s full of nuanced, measured, well-thought-out ideas for how to

            make the country better. Which is exactly why you’ve never heard of
            him. The editors of The Real Politicians waste no airtime on politicians
            like Kilmer because he’s measured and nuanced and I’m falling asleep
            just writing this sentence.</p>
          <p>Actual politics, like actual reality, is boring to most people. So tribal
            media brands do what reality TV producers do—they manufacture a
            carefully edited, fictional version of politics that’s wildly entertaining.</p>
          <p>That’s why most Americans who will tell you they’re passionate
            about politics can barely name ten current members of Congress. They
            probably can’t name all the U.S. representatives from their state, let
            alone members of their state legislatures. But they can tell you about
            the 10 or 15 politicians chosen by the media to be the main characters
            on The Real Politicians, along with the five or ten hot button issues the
            show features in any given month.
          </p>
          <p>Concentrated tribalism has led to increased division—but The Real
            Politicians adds fuel to the fire by making the distinction between the
            parties seem even more stark than it actually is.</p>
          <p>Take the issue of climate change, where we’re regularly presented
            with this storyline:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="side">
          <div class="image">

            So I was surprised to see this data:

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Which suggests that things are more like this:</p>
        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Very different story. Of course, it’s also true that many Republican
            politicians have been dismissive of climate change. And “doing things
            to protect the environment” is not necessarily the same as taking
            action to curb emissions. But the survey makes me feel very differently
            about the strategies climate activists should be using to build the
            necessary coalition to change our trajectory.
          </p>
          <p>Presenting an inaccurate version of reality breeds misplaced anger
            and division and hurts our ability to move toward important goals—all
            in the name of editing the reality show to be more entertaining with
            crisper, juicier storylines.</p>
          <p>The most dramatic events on The Real Politicians are elections.
            Elections are the show’s climactic season finales. And the show’s
            editors make sure to over-dramatize the shit out of them.</p>
          <p>This is the past century of U.S. presidential elections.</p>

            It’s a clear zig-zag pattern. And yet, I remember when Bush won
            reelection in 2004, media commentators were talking about how
            Democrats couldn’t win races anymore for a number of seemingly
            rock-solid sociological reasons. Then the Democrats swept the
            midterms in 2006 and won the presidency in 2008.
          </p>
          <p>I remember in 2012, when Obama won reelection, hearing people
            say that the country had fundamentally shifted, that there were more
            first-generation Americans than there used to be, that the Tea Party
            had rendered the Republican Party irrelevant, and all of this other
            proof that times had changed and the Democrats wouldn’t ever lose a
            presidential election again.</p>
          <p>Then Republicans swept all three branches of government in 2016,
            at which point I read all these articles about how the Left is more
            culturally powerful, but the Right is simply more politically powerful. I
            also heard a bunch of stuff about how gerrymandering ensured that
            the Democrats would never win back the House again. In 2018, the
            Democrats won the House and then swept the Congress, Senate, and
            presidency in 2020.</p>
          <p>I don’t know what truly motivates today’s media. Maybe they make
            politically motivated propaganda. Maybe they make profit-motivated
            entertainment, which happens to double as political propaganda.
            Whatever the motivation, the consequence is the same: enhanced
            political tribalism.</p>
          <p>Around a decade after the transformation to narrowcasting began,
            another technological development added even more fuel to the fire.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="headh2">
          <p><b><span>Internet Algorithms</span></b></p>
        </h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>I appreciate the Google search algorithm. It filters results that are
            most relevant to where I live and what I’m typically interested in, and it
            can guess remarkably well what I want to search for after I type just a
            few letters, saving me the trouble of typing the whole search.</p>
          <p>I appreciate the YouTube algorithm, which knows my favorite
            channels and makes sure I never miss their latest videos.</p>
          <p>I appreciate the Facebook algorithm, which spares me the
            knowledge of what Jake from high school 20 years ago made for
            dinner last night while making sure to let me know when Jake gets
            engaged, so I can go look through his 87 most recent photos to see the
            deal with his fiancé.</p>
          <p>Internet algorithms can be great things.</p>
          <p>But new technology often comes along with unanticipated
            consequences.</p>
          <p>When I’m watching a YouTube video and I glance at the thumbnails
            on the sidebar, I’m more likely to click on a video featuring someone
            explaining history or science than I am to click on a video featuring
            someone reviewing movies. YouTube has picked up on that, which is
            why I never see movie review videos on my YouTube sidebar, but I’m
            constantly being introduced to new history or science explainer
            videos.</p>
          <p>But then one night last year, someone sent me a funny video a
            driver took with their phone. The driver taking the video had pissed off
            another driver, who opened his window and started screaming curses.
            The angry driver got so worked up that he swung his arm at the video-
            taking driver angrily, and in the process, punched his own side mirror
            off. A delight of all delights.</p>
          <p>Then the video ended, and YouTube offered me my choice of nine
            more videos in the road rage genre. I clicked on one of them and
            watched it. Then YouTube offered me nine more. I had a lot of work to
            do, so I held down the Command key and clicked on all nine, opening

            them in nine new tabs, and watched them all. Two hours later, utterly

            disgusted with myself, I pulled the dramatic “punishing Chrome by
            holding down Command-Q and closing all eight Chrome windows and
            all 127 of their open tabs” move. A nightmare waste of time. But at
            least it was over.</p>
          <p>Except it wasn’t over. Somewhere out there, the YouTube algorithm
            was baiting its Tim Urban fishhook with the best of the best road rage
            videos, which have reliably appeared in my YouTube sidebar ever since
            that regrettable night, damning me to an entire life wasted watching
            hilarious road rage videos.</p>
          <p>Internet algorithms are profit-maximizing mechanisms that want to
            spoon-feed me whatever I’m most likely to click on. This is a win-win,
            symbiotic relationship—until it’s not. When an algorithm is jibing with
            your Higher Mind, it’s your friend. When it’s luring in your Primitive
            Mind against your Higher Mind’s will, the relationship is parasitic.</p>
          <p>So how does this apply to politics? Primitive Minds like to click on
            political junk food. They’re drawn to articles and videos that don’t just
            report the news but sensationalize it and make it entertaining. The
            YouTube sidebar can quickly turn into a wall of The Real Politicians of
            Washington D.C. content the same way YouTube inundated me with
            road rage videos. This feeds political tribalism and distorts our picture
            of reality.</p>
          <p>Then there’s social media, a phenomenon so peculiar and so specific
            to modern times that it would seem incomprehensible to everyone
            who came before us. Social media doesn’t just amplify political junk
            food, it plays a role in shaping it. When a new political news story
            makes waves, thousands of hot takes quickly bubble up. It’s not

            necessarily the most accurate takes that rise to the top but those that
            are most likely to make people click the retweet or share button—
            those that have the catchiest wording and hit the right emotional

            buttons. Through an almost evolutionary process, complex topics
            are dumbed down and packaged into irresistible nuggets for our
            Primitive Minds.</p>
          <p>Only a minority of people are hyperpartisan. But internet
            algorithms make people who are already extreme even more

            extreme. On social media, these voices disproportionately drive the
            conversation, making people feel like things are even more nasty and

            polarized than they actually are.</p>
          <p>In the 2020 documentary The Social Dilemma, computer scientist

            Jaron Lanier uses Wikipedia as an example to highlight the craziness
            of this situation:</p>
          <p>When you go to a [Wikipedia] page, you’re seeing the same
            thing as other people. So it’s one of the few things online that
            we at least hold in common. Now, just imagine for a second that
            Wikipedia said, “We’re gonna give each person a different
            customized definition, and we’re gonna be paid by people for
            that.” So, Wikipedia would be spying on you. Wikipedia would
            calculate, “What’s the thing I can do to get this person to
            change a little bit on behalf of some commercial interest?”
            Right? And then it would change the entry. Can you imagine
            that? Well, you should be able to, ‘cause that’s exactly what’s
            happening on Facebook. It’s exactly what’s happening in your
            YouTube feed.</p>
          <p>What happens on social media often determines what happens in
            the actual media. In his book Why We’re Polarized, Ezra Klein talks
            about the way journalists choose what to cover—the way they decide
            what is newsworthy. “A shortcut to newsworthiness,” he says, “has
            always been whether other news organizations are covering a story—
            if they are, then it’s newsworthy by definition.”</p>
          <p>In the past, audience members had limited ability to influence what
            news was covered. But social media changes the equation. “In the
            modern era,” Klein writes, “a shortcut to newsworthiness is social
            media virality; if people are already talking about a story or a tweet,

            that makes it newsworthy almost by definition.”</p>
          <p>It’s a vicious cycle. As political junk food pulls audiences further into

            Political Disney World,23 the low-rung narratives go more viral, more
            often, on social media. These viral narratives are then converted into a
            wave of new junk food media content, which reinforces and legitimizes
            the ideas circulating on social media. The connectivity of the internet
            melds media and its audiences into a single self-perpetuating system.</p>
          <p>It's no surprise where all this leaves us.</p>

          <p>Pew data, collected since 1994, shows us that the gap between the

            When we hear about growing political division, most of us assume it
            means citizens are divided in their values—that people are unable to
            agree about What Should Be. But take another look at the ten
            questions from Pew. There’s an element of What Should Be embedded
            in some of the questions—but mostly, they are questions about What

            Is. Many are statements about the status quo that the two political
            sides do not agree on.
          </p>
          <p>
            We see the same story again and again. A 2020 poll called Dueling
            Realities found that 81% of Republicans believe “the Democratic Party
            has been taken over by socialists,” while 78% of Democrats believe
            “the Republican Party has been taken over by racists.” In 2022, Pew
            found that 72% of Americans believe that “on the issues that matter to
            them, their side in politics has been losing more often than winning”
            while only 24% felt that their side was winning more than losing—a
            natural result of political media that increasingly focuses on grievance
            and negativity.
          </p>
          <p>A 2017 survey titled “The Parties in our Heads” had an even more
            revealing finding: the more political news respondents consumed, the
            more skewed their perception of members of the other party.</p>
          <p>Separate realities are a natural consequence of market incentives
            moving from the North Star region closer to the lower corners of the
            Media Matrix, where there’s almost no overlap in coverage between
            the two sides. It makes sense that those most hooked on political
            media would be the most delusional, the same way consumers of
            political news in dog-raccoon-ville left the pro-dog and pro-raccoon
            crowds with totally different perceptions of reality.</p>

          <p><b><span>A Rise in Bigotry</span></b></p>
        </h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>News media is infamous for what we could call “destructive cherry-
            picking”—a selection bias that sees negative stories as the most
            newsworthy, because they draw the most interest. It’s why, for
            example, Americans surveyed by Gallup since 1990 consistently think
            crime is increasing, even though in almost every one of those years, it

            decreased from the year before.</p>
          <p>Destructive cherry-picking spreads fear and pessimism, and over

            the past 20 years, it’s been steadily on the rise. In political media, this
            can have especially dangerous consequences.</p>
          <p>Geographic sorting means many people barely spend time with
            anyone on the other political side, so the only information they have
            on what those people are like comes through distorted media and
            social media filters. The right-wing narrative floods right-wing people
            with anecdotes that make it seem like everyone on the left positively
            despises them and everything they stand for, and vice versa. Outrage
            about these messages then spreads like wildfire on social media.</p>
          <p>Vocal Primitive Minds activate other Primitive Minds. Presenting
            people with a steady stream of “they hate you” jolts awake their
            Primitive Minds, in many cases filling them with reciprocal disdain,
            clouding their humanity, and flipping on that ancient tribal switch that
            makes people want to band together into golems. Portraying a society

            where everyone hates each other becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
            So it’s no surprise that between 1994 and 2022, the percentage of
            people who rate the opposing party as "very unfavorable" has tripled.</p>
          <p>It doesn’t take long before this awakens the scariest human
            emotion of all: disgust.</p>
          <p>Like happiness, sadness, anger, and fear, disgust is a basic emotion,
            meaning that it’s hardwired into all humans. Basic emotions were
            helpful for survival in the ancient human world. A Google Images
            search for “disgust” shows a bunch of people, all making the same
            hideous face—squinting their eyes, curling up their noses, and exhaling
            (and if it gets really bad, exhaling turns to gagging and eventually
            vomiting). Scientists believe this is evolution’s way of getting us to
            close up our incoming passages and expel outward whatever we can, in
            order to protect ourselves when we’re in the presence of toxins or
            disease. We react this way to anything our primitive software believes
            is potentially dangerous and disease-carrying—like rotten food, blood,
            feces, or maggots.</p>
          <p>
            The strange thing is that disgust can carry over to how we
            view people. There’s a sizable amount of research that suggests that
            when people are exposed to something that brings out their disgust
            emotion, they become harsher moral judges. In one experiment, a
            group of Canadians were shown disturbing-but-not-disgusting images

            of car accidents while another was shown photos of coughing people
            and other disease-related visuals. Then both groups were questioned
            about which countries they felt Canada should try to attract
            immigrants from. Both groups showed a preference for immigrants
            from familiar countries over immigrants from less familiar countries,
            but the group that had seen images of disease felt this preference
            much more strongly. In another study, participants sitting at a dirty
            desk were harsher in their judgments of a series of criminal acts than
            participants sitting at a clean desk. In another, a wafting noxious odor
            made participants feel less warmly toward gay men.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scientists use the term “behavioral immune system” to describe the
            theory that disgust in humans is linked to xenophobia and discomfort
            with practices and rituals (especially sexual) that seem foreign or
            different to us—an ancient impulse we developed long ago, when
            contact with foreign people and practices often did put you at risk of
            disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason I call disgust the scariest of all human emotions is that
            it’s a trigger for dehumanization, and dehumanization is the doorway
            to the worst things humans do. It’s not a coincidence that two of the
            most horrifying events in recent human history—the Holocaust and
            the Rwandan genocide—were made possible by disgust. Nazi
            propaganda constantly compared Jews to disgust-inducing animals

            like rats, swine, and insects. The Rwandan radio broadcasts that
            incited the 1994 genocide referred to Tutsis as “cockroaches”

            repeatedly. These are just two examples of a well-worn tradition.30
            Disgust fills our mind with a special kind of primitive fog—one that
            turns ordinary humans into psychopaths who can commit or condone

            unthinkable harm without remorse. Scary shit.

          </p>
          <p>
            Geographic sorting and political junk food make a lethal combo,

            ripe for disgust. It’s hard to feel dehumanizing disgust for people you
            know personally. Less hard when you rarely see your enemies in
            person. Less hard still when destructive cherry-picking teaches you
            only the worst about them. As affective polarization has risen, political

            opponents have gone from seeming like wrong or stupid people to
            seeming like disgusting people.
          </p>
          <p>
            We like to think of bigotry as something that other people do. But
            we’re all capable of rank bigotry when our environment pushes the
            right buttons in our psyche.
          </p>
          <p>Political bigotry is as real as any other bigotry. In a 2014 paper on
            political polarization in the U.S., political scientist Shanto Iyengar and
            researcher Sean J. Westwood find evidence that “hostile feelings for
            the opposing party are ingrained or automatic in voters’ minds” and
            that “partisans discriminate against opposing partisans, doing so to a

            degree that exceeds discrimination based on race.”⬥</p>
          <p>Bigotry is at its most dangerous when it goes unrecognized. The

            best tools to combat bigotry are social norms that penalize its
            expression—but today in the U.S., political bigotry is rarely treated as
            taboo.</p>

          <p>Human environments are made up of a complex fabric of culture,
            norms, values, laws, and prevailing beliefs. Changes to any element of
            our environment can trigger changes in other parts of the
            environment, which in turn can cause more changes.</p>
          <p>We discussed the way that the advent of tribal media made people
            more partisan and more hooked on political junk food, and how the
            resulting rise in demand pushed media to be even more tribal and one-
            sided.</p>
          <p>A similar feedback loop has taken place between voters and
            politicians. Increasingly partisan politicians draw constituents deeper
            into Political Disney World, and a lower-rung electorate is more likely
            to reward politicians who cater to the low-rung mindset and snub the
            politicians who act like grown-ups. As political tribalism has ramped up,
            the number of undecided votes has dwindled. It makes less sense than

            it used to for candidates to try to persuade moderate voters and more
            sense to run hyperpartisan, negative campaigns that fire up their base and

            increase turnout.</p>
          <p>And as the media’s political coverage has morphed into a reality
            TV show, it has created an incentive system that rewards politicians who
            use inflammatory rhetoric. As the famously bombastic Representative
            Newt Gingrich has put it: “You have to give them confrontations. When you

            give them confrontations, you get attention.” Politicians who act like
            children are great TV, which incentivizes the media to give them more
            airtime, which helps those politicians win elections, which encourages
            more of the same behavior.</p>
          <p>In the first part of this chapter, we talked about how the distributed
            political tribalism of the 1960s coalesced into a single, concentrated
            tribal divide—an environment that makes a populace more vulnerable
            to the pull of the low rungs. When this was coupled with other changes
            in geography, media, and social media, it sent the country spinning
            down a vortex of negative feedback loops.</p>

            We started this book talking about moths. Moths navigate using moonlight, and in the world they were
            programmed to live in, that system worked fine. The issue for today’s moths is that their environment has
            changed but their programming has not, so now they spend their nights doing pointless circles around your
            porch light.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m pretty sure this is our situation too. Human nature is a specific software program optimized for a
            specific purpose: survival in a small tribe, a long time ago. The modern world is nothing like the
            environment we evolved in.
          </p>
          <p>Our human nature is malleable based on our environment. Our identity (the source of our human nature) is
            formed based on information. Information that changes our programming and the way we filter the world, build
            moral frameworks, and decide what actions to take in life. </p>

            Human nature is a constant, and when you put that constant into different environments, it produces
            different behavior. That makes environment the independent variable. And human environments are
            complicated—for most of mankind this has solely included a physical environment, the surrounding people and
            cultures, the prevailing beliefs and belief systems, and the laws and rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            We used to get all of our information from peer to peer networks. People sharing books, stories, and
            experiences with each other. There was no non-human recommendation system that any humans subscribed to.
          </p>
          <p>Now much of the worlds information sharing happens through the digital realm, but rather than the
            information being directly sent from one person to another, we have placed an algorithmic middleman between
            you and the reader. The goal of this middleman is to filter the mundane, boring, or overly inspiring media
            which gets you off of the platform, and show whatever it can in order to keep you on that application
            longer. We become what we spend our attention on. We become who we hang out with and he internet made
            hanging out with crazy people normal.</p>
          <p>If you question why the world seems crazy, then know it's happening not by accident but by design. Because
            the business model is to keep you engaged. Which in other words, is a middleman who cares not about who you
            are, your dreams, your livelihood, or your purpose, but instead solely about how much value and time it can
            take from you. </p>
          <p>
            This chapter is about the persuasive technology that we have let capture the hearts and minds of our global
            consciousness. And persuasion is about an invisible asymmetry of power. When I was a kid, I was a magician.
            And magic teaches you that you can have asymmetric power without the other person realizing it. You can
            masquerade to have asymmetric power while looking like you have an equal relationship. You say pick a card
            any card. Meanwhile, you know exactly how to get that person to pick the card that you want. And
            essentially, what we're experiencing with technology is an increasing asymmetry of power that's been
            masquerading itself as a equal or contractual relationship where the responsibility is on us. </p>
          <p>So let's walk through why that's happening. In the race for attention, because there's only so much
            attention, companies have to get more of it by being more and more aggressive, I call it the race to the
            bottom of the brainstem. So it starts with techniques like pull to refresh. So you pull to refresh your
            newsfeed that operates like a slot machine. It has the same kind of addictive qualities that keep people in
            Las Vegas hooked gambling with their life savings into a machine, except in this case people are paying
            their attention. </p>
          <p>Another example is removing stopping cues. Imagine if your body got more thirsty the more you drank.</p>
          <p>That's what happens with infinitely scrolling feeds. We remove the stopping cues, and create such a high
            dopamine activity that all other activities seem boring, this is what keeps people scrolling. But the race
            for attention has to get more and more aggressive. And so it's not enough just to get your behavior and
            predict what will take your behavior. We have to predict how to keep you hooked in a different way. And so
            it crawled deeper down the brainstem into our social validation. </p>

            It's the algorithmic newsfeeds that incentivize "engagement" at the expense of our mental health.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the internet and video sharing has been around for awhile, the advent of Ai (which continues to get
            better at predicting what will make us addicted to these social slot machines) is a concerning path for
            humanity.

            Who can build a better predictive model of your behavior? And so if you give an example of YouTube. So there
            you are, you're about to hit play on a YouTube video and you hit play. And then you think you're going to
            watch this one video and then you wake up two hours later and say, oh my god, what just happened. And the
            answer is because you had a super computer pointed at your brain. And in the moment you hit play, it wakes
            up an avatar voodoo doll like version of you inside of a Google server. And that avatar based on all the
            clicks and likes and everything you've ever made, those are like your hair clippings and toenail clippings
            and nail filings that make the avatar look and act more and more like you. So that inside of a Google server
            they can simulate more and more possibilities if I prick you with this video, if I prick you with this
            video, how long would you stay? And the business model is simply what maximizes watch time.
          </p>
          <p>
            This leads to the kind of algorithmic extremism. And this is what's caused 70% of YouTube's traffic down to
            be driven by recommendations, not by human choice, but by the machines. And it's a race between Facebook's
            voodoo doll where you flick your finger, can they predict what to show you next? And Google's voodoo doll.
            And this is our abstract metaphor is that apply to the whole tech industry where it's a race between who can
            better take your attention.
          </p>
          <p>Facebook has something called loyalty prediction where they can actually predict to an advertiser when
            you're about to become disloyal to a brand. So if you're a mother and you take pampered diapers, they can
            tell pamper's, hey, this user is about to become disloyal to this brand. So in other words, they can predict
            things about us that we don't know about our own selves. And that's a new level of asymmetric power. And we
            have a name for this asymmetric relationship, which is a fiduciary relationship or a duty of care
            relationship.
          </p>
          <p>The same standard we applied it to doctors, to priests, to lawyers. Imagine a world in which priests only
            make their money by selling access to the confession booth to someone else. Except in this case, Facebook
            listens to two billion people's confessions has a super computer next to them and it's calculating and
            predicting confessions you're going to make before you know you're going to make them. And that's what's
            causing all this havoc. So I'd love to talk about more of these things later. I just want to finish up by
            saying this affects everyone, even if you don't use these products. You still send your kids to a school
            where other people believing that anti-vaccine conspiracy theories causes impact for your life or other
            people voting in your elections. And when Mark Andreesen once said, you know, in 2011, that the quote was,
            software is going to eat the world. And what he meant by that, Mark Andreesen was the founder of Netscape.
          </p>
          <p>What he meant by that was that software can do every part of society more efficiently than non-software,
            right? Because it's just adding efficiencies. And so we're going to allow software to eat up our elections.
            We're going to allow it to eat up our media, our taxi, our transportation. And the problem was that software
            was eating the world without taking responsibility for it. We used to have rules and standards around
            Saturday morning cartoons. And when YouTube gobbles up that part of society, it just takes away all of those
            protections. And I just want to finish up by saying that I know Mr. Rogers, Fred Rogers testified before
            this committee 50 years ago, concerned about the animated bombardment that we were showing children, I think
            he would be horrified today about what we're doing now. And at that same time, he was able to talk to the
            committee and that committee made a choice differently. So I'm hoping we can talk more about that today.
            Thank you. </p>
          <p>We know that internet platforms like Google and Facebook have vast quantities of data about each user. What
            can these companies predict about users based on that data? Thank you for the question. So I think there's
            an important connection to make between privacy and persuasion that I think often isn't linked. So maybe
            it's helpful to link that. With Cambridge Analytica, that was an event in which based on your Facebook
            likes, based on 150 of your Facebook likes, I could predict your political personality and then I could do
            things with that. The reason I described in my opening statement that this is about an increasing asymmetry
            of power is that without any of your data, I can predict increasing features about you using AI.
          </p>
          <p>There's a paper recently that with 80% accuracy, I can predict your same big five personality traits that
            Cambridge Analytica got from you. Without any of your data, all I have to do is look at your mouse movements
            and click patterns. In other words, it's the end of the poker face. Your behavior is your signature and we
            can know your political personality. Based on tweet text alone, we can actually know your political
            affiliation with about 80% accuracy. Computers can calculate probably that you're homosexual before. You
            might know that you're homosexual. They can predict with 95% accuracy that you're going to quit your job
            according to an IBM study. They can predict that you're pregnant. They can predict your micro expressions on
            your face better than a human being can. Your expressions are your soft reactions to things that you're not
            very visible but are invisibly visible. Computers can predict that. As you keep going and you realize that
            you can start to deep fake things, you can actually generate a new synthetic piece of media, a new synthetic
            face or a synthetic message that is perfectly tuned to these characteristics. The reason why I opened this
            statement by saying we have to recognize that what this is all about is a growing asymmetry of power between
            technology and the limits of the human mind. </p>
          <p>My favorite sociobiologist, E. Wilson, said the fundamental problem of humanity is that we have Paleolithic
            ancient emotions. We have medieval institutions and we have god-like technology. We're chimpanzees with
            nukes and our Paleolithic brains are limited against the increasing exponential power of technology at
            predicting things about us. The reason why it's so important to migrate this relationship from being
            extractive to get things out of you to being a fiduciary is you can't have asymmetric power that is
            specifically designed to extract things from you. You can't have lawyers or doctors whose entire business
            model is to take everything they learn and sell it to someone else. Except in this case, the level of things
            that we can predict about you is far greater than actually each of those fields combined when you actually
            add up all the data that assembles a more and more accurate voodoo doll of each of us. There's two billion
            voodoo dolls, by the way. There's one for one out of every four people on earth with YouTube's and Facebook
            are more than two billion people. Mr. Dan, thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you, Dore Witnesses, a
            fascinating discussion. I'd like to address an issue that I think is of profound importance to our
            democratic republic.</p>
          <p>That's the fact that in order to have a vibrant democracy, you need to have an exchange of ideas and an
            open platform. And certainly part of the promise of the internet, as it was first conceived, is that we'd
            have this incredible universal commons where a wide range of ideas would be discussed and debated. It would
            be robust. And yet it seems as if we're not getting that. We're actually getting more and more siloed. Mr.
            Dr. Wolfe from you mentioned how people could make choices and they could live in a bubble, but at least it
            would be their bubble that they get to live in. But that's what we're seeing throughout our society as
            polarization increases, more and more folks are reverting to tribal type behavior. </p>
          <p>You may be thinking, tribalism was alive and well in the past, and we're seeing advances in technology in a
            lot of ways bring us back into that kind of tribal behavior, to what extent is this technology actually
            accelerating that and is there a way out?</p>
          <p>There's a tendency to think here that this is just human nature. Now that's just people are polarized and
            this is just playing out. It's a mirror. It's holding up a mirror to society. But what it's really doing is
            it's an amplifier for the worst parts of us. So in the race to the bottom of the brain stem to get
            attention, let's take an example like Twitter. It's calculating what is the thing that I can show you that
            gets the most engagement. And it turns out that outrage, moral outrage gets the most engagement. So it was
            found in a study that for every word of moral outrage that you add to a tweet, it increases your retweet
            rate by 17%. So in other words, you know, the polarization of our society is actually part of the business
            model. Another example of this is that shorter, briefer things work better in attention economy than long,
            complex, nuanced ideas that take a long time to talk about. And so that's why you get 140 characters
            dominating our social discourse. But reality and the most important topics to us are increasingly complex,
            what we can say increasingly simple things about them that automatically creates polarization because you
            can't say something simple about something complicated and have everybody agree with you. People will, by
            definition, misinterpret and hate you for it. And then it's never been easier to retweet that and generate a
            mob that will come after you. And this is created to call out culture and chilling effects and a whole bunch
            of other subsequent effects in polarization that are amplified by the fact that these platforms are rewarded
            to give you the most sensational stuff. One last example of this is on YouTube.
          </p>
          <p>Yeah, that comment was that another example of we used to have protections that technology took away. We
            used to have equal price campaign ads so that it costs the same amount on the Tuesday night at 7pm for any
            candidate to run an election. When Facebook gobbles up that part of media, it just takes away those
            protections. So there's now no equal pricing. In terms of what I'm worried about, I'm mostly worried about
            the fact that none of these problems have been solved. The business model hasn't changed and the reason why
            you see a Christchurch event happen in the video just show up everywhere or any of these examples. And then
            mentally there's no easy way for these platforms to address this problem because the problem is their
            business model. Thank you, Senator. Yes, this is one of the issues that most concerns me. As I think Senator
            Schatz mentioned at the beginning, there's evidence that in the last month even as recently as that, keeping
            in mind that these issues have been reported on for years now, there was a pattern identified by YouTube
            that young girls who had taken videos of themselves dancing in front of cameras were linked in usage
            patterns to other videos like that that went further and further into that realm. And that was just
            identified by YouTube as a supercomputer as a pattern. It's a pattern of this is a kind of pathway that
            tends to be highly engaging.</p>
          <p>The way that we tend to describe this, if you imagine a spectrum on YouTube. On my left side, there's the
            calm Walter Cronkite section of YouTube. On the right-hand side, there's Crazy Town, UFOs, conspiracy
            theories, Bigfoot, whatever. And if you take a human being and you could drop them anywhere, you could drop
            them in the calm section or you could drop them in Crazy Town. But if I'm YouTube and I want you to watch
            more of which direction from there am I going to send you? I'm never going to send you to the calm section.
            I'm always going to send you towards Crazy Town. So now you imagine two billion people like an ant colony of
            humanity and it's tilting the playing field towards the Crazy stuff. And the specific examples of this a
            year ago, a teen girl who looked at a dieting video on YouTube would be recommended anorexia videos. Because
            that was the more extreme thing to show the voodoo doll that looked like a teen girl. There's all these
            voodoo dolls that look like that. And the next thing to show is anorexia. If you looked at a NASA moon
            landing, it would show flat earth conspiracy theories which recommended hundreds of millions of times before
            being taken down recently. I wrote down another example. 50% of white nationalists in a Bellingcat study had
            said that it was YouTube that had red-pilled them. Red-pilling is the term for the opening of the mind. The
            best predictor of whether you'll believe in a conspiracy theory is whether I can get you to believe in one
            conspiracy theory. Because one conspiracy sort of opens up the mind and makes you doubt and question things
            and say that get really paranoid. And the problem is that YouTube is doing this in mass and it's created
            sort of two billion personalized Truman shows. </p>
          <p>Each channel has that radicalizing direction. And if you think about it from an accountability perspective,
            back when we had Janet Jackson on one side of the TV screen at the Super Bowl and we had 60 million
            Americans in the other, we had a five-second TV delay and a bunch of humans in the loop for a reason. But
            what happens when you have two billion Truman shows, two billion possible Janet Jackson's and two billion
            people on the other end, it's a digital Frankenstein that's really hard to control. When YouTube recommends
            Flat Earth conspiracy theories hundreds of millions of times, and if you consider that 70% of YouTube's
            traffic is driven by recommendations, meaning driven by what they are recommending when an algorithm is
            choosing to put in front of the eyeballs of a person. It's, if you were to backwards derive a motto, it
            would be with great power, it comes no responsibility.</p>
          <p>Its time we take responsibility into our own hands.</p>
          <p>Remember, each one of us makes up the environment of every other human and each one of us is capable of
            more than we could imagine if we are willing to devote ourselves to becoming so.</p>
          <p>Many kings, emperors, and warlords of the past have done environments the Power Games way, governing with
            totalitarian power, strict laws, and harsh penalties in order to generate controlled and obedient behavior.
          </p>
          <p>Thinkers of the Enlightenment believed they could improve upon this. They believed the same good behavior
            could be generated with a gentler, fairer, more hands-off form of government.</p>
          <p>The digital world is an artificial environment, carefully crafted to both contain human nature and convert
            it into an engine of extraction. Like all environments, it’s a behavior-shaping mechanism.</p>
          <p>It’s natural to take our environment for granted—to assume that that’s “just the way things work.” But the
            engagement algorithm is a human construct, held in place not only by laws but by the “support beam” of the
            high-rung immune system—by shared notions of what is and isn’t tolerable or harmful and by shared
            determination to uphold those standards. When that support beam weakens, the environment can quickly
            collapse back to the more natural human habitat of the Power Games.</p>
          <p>In our era of exponential progress, rapid changes to our environment have put our culture under great
            strain. Primitive Minds have instinctually rushed in to fill many of the new power vacuums. New golems have
            congealed together and have begun stomping through our societies like Godzilla, growing more emboldened with
            each passing year. These golems have infected the societies’ vital organs—their institutions—impeding their
            ability to function properly and causing a mass crisis of trust. In the chaos of exponential progress, our
            societies are beginning to lose their grip.</p>
          <p>We might think of our globe-spanning post-industrial civilization as an extended body. This suggests that
            humanity-plus-Earth has, at least, an opportunity to evolve into a unified, harmonic planetary
            super-organism, if we can make the shift — we might consider it a “quantum leap” — from competition to
            cooperation as our basis for our activity. Such a drastic mutation in our consciousness and social practices
            is not an overnight success, but a constant happening.</p>
          <p>We might look at multinational corporations as the decentralized organs of our planetary super-organism.
            They build and operate the technological systems and infrastructures — the shipping lines, extraction
            industries, recycling plants, satellite systems, etcetera — spread across the Earth. Energy companies, for
            example, function like the body’s circulatory system, keeping the body moving. Media companies act like
            sensory organs: They register the raw data of what’s happening (wars, earthquakes, supply chain breakdowns)
            and convert it into memes, myths, narratives which guide the collective body’s decisions and movements. The
            money system functions like the super-organism’s nervous system, flickering instantaneously, directing
            energy and resources to billions of nodal points across the human/planetary symbiote. We can all be thought
            of as the neurons of the brain.
          </p>
          <p>Our global colossus’s information sharing system has been hijacked with a demonic system optimized to
            signal to each nueron that it needs to be upset, that the body is sick, that the cell should attack other
            cells because of it, or get angry at them. </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, we drive this gigantic apparatus – both made by us yet separate from us and seemingly out of
            our control – with the wrong set of goals and principles. Under the fragmented individualist/materialist
            paradigm, people, companies, and nations strive for power, dominance, and control. Forms of control include
            control over physical regions of the Earth, over intellectual property rights, or over human consciousness
            using techniques of manipulation and indoctrination. We have lost contact with other ideals or potentials
            that could redirect our still-immature super-organism away from toying with oblivion (currently we’re
            playing Russian Roulette with biospheric self-extinction).</p>
          <p>This is an unfortunately common pattern through history. People who live through bad times, like the world
            wars, witness the fragility of human civilization firsthand. This harsh dose of reality has them saying,
            “never again,” which gets their priorities in order and leads to
            wise decisions. These wise decisions protect future society from the kind of bad times they experienced.</p>
          <p>But when times are good for long enough, we start to get cocky. We forget that the only reason times are
            good is because of principles fervently agreed upon by people who had been through hell. When we grow
            complacent about those principles, the safeguards put in place by older generations deteriorate. And the
            people of good times never see the rise of new bad times until it’s too late to stop them.
          </p>

            round. In a super high-tech era like ours, it’s an especially scary
            prospect. We live in a time of magical technology, and the power of the
            human species grows more godlike every year. This power is a double-
            edged sword, simultaneously paving one road to utopia and another to
            dystopia. As we move into the deeply uncertain future of page 1,001
            of The Story of Us, there’s never been a more important time to have
            our wits about us.</p>
          <p>Which is also why there’s never been a worse time for us to be
            spiraling down a vortex of confusion and fear. Exponential technology
            has given us countless gifts. But in the frenzy, we’re forgetting the
            most important lesson of all: the worst of our nature never lies far
            beneath the surface.
          </p>
          <p>It’s not that these heavily featured politicians or the played-up
            storylines are unimportant. It’s that we receive a
            totally skewed depiction of the full set of relevant political issues. The
            issues that make headlines day in and day out are usually
            overrepresented, while lots of other important political stories—like
            the bills being approved each week by the 50 House and Senate
            committees—are woefully underreported.</p>
          <p>We really can’t afford to get ourselves from foolish to wise the
            usual way, via bad times. Somehow, we have to figure how to become
            wise people directly.

            People have asked me if I’m optimistic or pessimistic about our future. Truthfully, it depends on the day.
            While I can’t say I’m confidently optimistic, I believe there’s a strong
            case for optimism. A few reasons why:
          </p>
          <p>The exhausted majority is sick of this shit. Both my own life experience and a mountain of data point to an
            enduring truth: Most people—old and young, Black and white, progressive and conservative, American and
            non-American—are good-hearted, highly reasonable, and yearning for unity much more than division. Most
            people want free speech, dislike cancel culture, and prefer respectful elected officials. The exhausted
            majority is a sleeping giant with immense potential energy.</p>
          <p>The internet is a double-edged sword. The internet gave birth to a digital cudgel that has given power to
            mobs, but that same internet also means it’s almost impossible to truly silence free speech today. The kinds
            of tactics that have allowed extreme movements or authoritarian demagogues to conquer nations of the past
            are up against far greater odds in today’s ultra-connected environment.</p>
          <p>Most of these bad stories are very recent. The majority of stories in this book happened in 2020 or later.
            We’re in the beginning of the story, not the end. There have been periods of chaos and instability
            throughout American history, and in each case, the country ultimately
            prevailed. There’s a reason liberal democracies have persisted for centuries: they’re remarkably robust and
            resilient.</p>
          <p>The tide seems to be slowly turning. In the time between when I started this book and today, I watched
            confusion and fear swell up and then more recently, appear to wane a bit. Companies that have held strong in
            the face of SJF pressure, like tech giant Shopify, have not only survived but thrived. Voices in the media
            are beginning to show signs of their old integrity, like Erik Wemple’s late-2022 Washington Post op-ed
            acknowledging that James Bennet’s firing at The New York Times was wrong (“[It’s] long past time to ask why
            more people who claim to uphold journalism and free expression ... didn’t speak out then in Bennet’s
            defense. It’s because we were afraid to.”) The exhausted majority spoke with their votes in 2022, when they
            denied seats to every 2020-election-denying nominee for state offices that hold authority over the voting
            process.8 Over at Evergreen, the exhausted
            majority has spoken as well. Since the 2017 debacle, enrollment has fallen by 50%. The ACLU may not be what
            it used to be, but FIRE has picked up the mantle defending Americans’ civil liberties—and they’ll soon be
            expanding their work beyond college campuses. Every year,
            new organizations are popping up dedicated to civil discourse and bridging political divides—you can find
            dozens of them on bridgealliance.org.</p>
          <p>But for this story to actually have a happy ending, this tide reversal needs much more momentum. And every
            person reading this can play a part in making it happen.</p>

            While writing this book, I found myself in countless discussions
            about the various topics in it. Some were productive, others weren’t.
            The unproductive discussions always felt the same at the time: I’m
            trying to reason with someone, but they’re a hopeless low-rung
            thinker. It’s like arguing with a brick wall.
          </p>
          <p>
            But this is how unproductive discussions always feel. Even when
            you’re the brick wall.
          </p>
          <p>Looking back, I’ve been writing and talking about the high rungs and
            low rungs while sometimes battling to stay up on the high rungs
            myself. There have been moments during research when I’ve caught
            myself judging academic papers by whether they confirmed or
            disconfirmed my hypotheses. There have been times during
            arguments when I couldn’t help but get emotional, where my ego was
            way too involved, where I was only listening to what the other person
            was saying in order to come up with my next response.</p>
          <p>The first part of our solution is awareness, and the gateway to
            awareness is humility.
          </p>
          <p>We all spend time in Unconvinceable Land as Attorneys, sometimes
            even as Zealots. We all identify a little too much with certain ideas.
            We’re all unknowingly standing on Child’s Hill with at least a few
            topics, where our level of conviction far exceeds our level of

            knowledge. When it comes to the beliefs we hold most sacred, we’re
            all prone to confirmation bias. In one way or another, we’re all gullible,
            all in denial, all delusional Disney protagonists. We all have out-groups
            and we all dehumanize the people in them. We’re all tribal. We’re all
            hypocrites. We’re all wrong. Because we’re all human.</p>
          <p>The most important thing for us to remember is that we do our
            rational and moral thinking with a not-that-smart tool that was
            designed to keep an ancient primate alive. Staying aware of this can
            help us be our wisest selves and reach our potential.</p>
          <p>So the first call to action is: Put your own mask on before helping
            others.</p>
          <p>Do a self-audit. Where in your internal life is your Primitive Mind
            holding the reins? What are the triggers that activate your Primitive
            Mind and leave you buried in fog? Where do you tend to be at your
            best—consistently high rung, wise, and grown up? What is it about
            those moments that gives your Higher Mind such a strong advantage?
            Can you replicate that elsewhere?</p>
          <p>Think about your beliefs. Play the “why” game with them, like an
            annoying four-year-old. Why do you believe what you believe? When
            did those ideas become your beliefs? Were they installed in you by
            someone else? Are they beholden to some tribe’s checklist of
            approved ideas? If they are authentically yours, when were they last
            updated? Your Primitive Mind thinks your beliefs are sacred objects
            carved in stone, but they’re not—they’re hypotheses written in pencil,
            and if you’re thinking up on the high rungs, you should probably be
            pretty active with the eraser.</p>
          <p>Think about your values. If you love a political party or a movement
            because it stands for your values, and that party or movement slides
            away from those values, are you sticking with it out of tribal loyalty?
            Or because your values have truly changed alongside it? If the party or
            movement has departed from your real values, stick with your values.
            If you do, you’ll be accused of having changed—of having “left” the
            party or movement. But that’s not what happened. It left you, and you
            stayed true to yourself.</p>
          <p>Think about the beliefs of those you disagree with. Do they have
            any merit? Could you state them to your opponent, in all their
            complexity, in a way that would make your opponent say, “Yup, that’s
            what I believe”? Or would you oversimplify or misrepresent those
            beliefs? If you can’t steel man your opponent’s beliefs, you don’t yet
            know whether you disagree with them or not. Everyone believes they
            are fighting on the side of the good, the right, the vulnerable—even
            your opponents.</p>
          <p>Think about your identity. The truth is, you’re not a progressive or a
            conservative or a moderate or radical or some other political noun.
            Those are words for ideas, not people. Your mind is way too weird and
            particular to be locked in a noun or adjective prison. Attaching a
            political category to your identity is a heavy piece of baggage to carry
            around, and putting it down makes learning and exploring much easier
            and less stressful.</p>
          <p>Think about people or groups you hate. Who are you disgusted by?
            Remind yourself that this is almost always a delusion of your Primitive
            Mind. You certainly don't have to like everybody. But when you’re
            disgusted by a person or a group of people, you've gotten swallowed
            up by human craziness. When you find yourself here, try one of these
            exercises to snap yourself out of it:</p>
          <p>Think small. Imagine the little details of the life of the person you’re
            hating: the sticky note they leave in their kid’s lunchbox, the calendar
            on their wall with little plans written in the squares, the leftovers in
            their fridge from last night’s home-cooked meal. Like you, everyone
            else is ultimately just trying to be happy.</p>
          <p>Think big. Read about the universe. Nothing makes hatred seem
            more ridiculous than internalizing how vast time and space are. Doing
            so makes me want to turn to anyone who will listen and hug them and
            say, “We both exist! On the same tiny planet at the same exact time!
            Hi!”</p>
          <p>Think outside yourself. Every person has a unique childhood, a
            unique set of traumas, unique mental health issues. There are many
            people not lucky enough to be born as intellectually or emotionally

            intelligent as you were, not lucky enough to have an
            upbringing like yours. You have no idea what kind of
            grief, heartbreak, or other misfortune another person
            may be suffering through. However awful someone is
            acting, it would probably make a lot more sense if you
            could spend a few minutes inside their brain.</p>
          <p>I’ve been using a little mantra. When I’m down on
            the low rungs and I have a moment of self-awareness
            where I realize I’m on the low rungs, I say in my head:</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="headh2">
          <p><b><span>Climb</span></b></p>
        </h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>It’s not a scolding moment, it’s a moment of self-
            compassion. I’m doing that thing that every human
            does sometimes. It’s okay. I caught myself. Climb.</p>
          <p>Once you’ve begun to address your internal tug-of-
            war, turn your attention outwards. What do your
            surroundings look like through the Ladder lens?</p>
          <p>Think about the people you love. Where are they
            great at being high-rungers? Where do they struggle
            down on the low rungs? When someone is acting like a monster, they’re not a monster, they’re a human mired
            in an internal tug-of-war and losing. We all have topics that bring out our most biased, irrational selves.
            We all have areas of embarrassing ignorance. You might be a better high-runger than they are about a
            particular thing—but they are almost certainly better at it than you in some other area.</p>

            social bully? Where are you the bully?</p>
          <p>
            Think about the media you read or watch. Where does it fall in the
            Media Matrix?
          </p>
          <p>
            We used to get all of our information from peer to peer networks. People sharing books, stories, and
            experiences with each other. There was no non-human recommendation system that any humans subscribed to.
          </p>
          <p>Rather than search for the perfect media source, right at the
            intersection of accuracy and neutrality, assume that every company,
            every journalist, every podcaster, every talking head is flawed—

            because they are, because they’re all human—and diversify your media
            portfolio. Try to get a sprinkling from across the spectrum. Think of the
            various voices as the biased lawyers in the courtroom of your mind.
            Watching their ideas clash will help you, the juror, get closer to the
            truth.</p>
          <p>Practice thinking “vertically” about your society, its industries, its
            cultures, its politics. Slap the Ladder onto all these things and see what
            they look like. Where do you see high-rung and low-rung psychology
            or behavior playing out? Where are people seeking truth vs. seeking
            confirmation? Where do you see moral consistency and where do you
            see hypocrisy? Who’s using persuasion to get what they want and
            who’s using coercion?</p>

            We looked at story after story of companies and institutions facing
            what we called “a moment of truth”—situations in which leaders were
            forced to choose between integrity and popularity. In story after story,
            these moments went wrong, not because leadership didn’t know the
            right thing to do but because they lacked the courage to lead. My hope
            is not for the demise of the institutions we talked about in this book
            but that they’ll have the guts to start acting like themselves again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each of us faces the same kinds of moments of truth too, in our
            everyday interactions. These moments are hard because our not-that-
            smart brains are wired to be afraid of certain things it was good to be
            afraid of in 50,000 BC—like not pleasing authority, not fitting in, or
            being socially out-grouped. In many instances, having courage today
            doesn’t require putting yourself in danger—it just requires you
            overriding your Primitive Mind’s incorrect assessment of danger.
            Because a lot of what the Primitive Mind is terrified of isn’t actually
            dangerous at all.

          <p>
            One of the most consistent themes in the stories in this book is that
            people who have been attacked by a political golem—smeared,
            shunned, threatened, fired—said they received a lot of private but
            little public support. The invisible elephant in all of this is the giant

            mass of silent skeptics. In an environment like that, every time a silent
            skeptic starts speaking out and becomes a vocal skeptic, it has a huge
            impact.
          </p>
          <p>But you don’t need to go that full distance to have an impact. There
            are different degrees of courage.

          <p>Marcus Aurelius once wrote, "If it is not right, do not do it. If it is not
            true, do not say it." Refraining from participation in something you
            don’t believe in is just a small step in the right direction—but if

            agree with or dehumanizing an out-group in a way you find distasteful,

            because low-rung social environments put a lot of pressure on
            everyone to pledge outward allegiance to the tribe’s sacred beliefs or
            express hatred of the tribe’s enemies. Try it anyway. Think of it like

          <p><b>Courage level 2:<span> Start saying what you really think, in
                private, with people you know well</span></b></p>
        </h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>This is when you begin letting your Inner Self show itself in public.</p>
          <p>Start with the people you’re closest with. Are there political or social
            topics you have to be in the closet about with them? If so, consider
            whether your relationship might become better and more interesting
            if you stopped self-censoring. Becoming more authentic usually seems

            scarier than it proves to be. And it might make the relationship closer,
            more fun, and less stressful.</p>
          <p>This can also have another benefit: collaborative growth. </p>
          <p>Try
            explaining the Ladder to people and promise that you’ll tell each other
            when the other is being low rung or acknowledge your own low
            rungness when you become self-aware of it. You’re building a support
            network, which can be incredibly productive. It’s not only great for
            everyone involved, helping to fast-track personal growth, it can help
            the group become more of an Idea Lab and less of boring Echo
            Chamber.</p>
          <p>Of course, sometimes a person or relationship or group just isn’t
            ready for these discussions yet, and that’s okay too. Be as high rung as
            you can around those people, and some of it just might rub off.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="headh2">
          <p><b>Courage level 3:<span> Go public</span></b></p>
        </h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Class. Work. Church. Book clubs. Dinner parties. This isn’t an
            encouragement to become the insufferable person who always brings
            up politics. But if you’re in a setting where a conversation is happening
            and your Inner Self is screaming “I disagree!”—start saying, “I
            disagree.” I can almost guarantee that at least some other people in the
            room will secretly be harboring the same thoughts, and they’ll respect
            the shit out of you for saying it out loud.</p>
          <p>You could go even bigger. Start a blog. Start a podcast. Write a book.
            Tweet a tweet. Spend six years writing a 120,000-word
            ebook/audiobook. If you already have a platform, start laying your
            Inner Self on it.</p>
          <p>This is not for everyone. If you want to be a full hero and throw your
            career away going down in flames, all power to you (and you’ll
            probably have a soft landing into a group of awesome new friends), but
            I’m talking here to everybody else—everyone who can take their ideas
            public without any major consequences.</p>
          <p>For many of us, the fear of putting it all out there is mostly in our
            own heads. Specifically, in our Primitive Minds.</p>
          <p>If that’s you, here’s a tip for getting your Primitive Mind on board
            with the plan. Remind yourself that whatever you’re putting out there
            in the world will win you the respect of some people and lose you the
            respect of some others. And ask yourself: whose respect do I care
            about?</p>
          <p>For me, that question had an obvious answer. The people whose
            respect I care about are people who think it’s cool to say what you
            really think, who think it’s cool to throw hypotheses out there, the
            people who like to play around with all kinds of ideas. If I put myself
            out there, in conversations, in larger settings, and publicly, I’ll end up
            surrounding myself with those kinds of people.</p>
          <p>Conversely, if you’re hiding your Inner Self out of fear, you’re going
            to end up surrounded by people who like the person you’re pretending
            to be. Meanwhile, the people who actually like you don’t realize they
            like you. I can pretty much guarantee that your Inner Self has some
            major admirers out there. Why not find out who they are?</p>
          <p>You don’t need to upend your whole life, lose your job, or destroy
            your friendships to exhibit courage. Taking any of these steps is way,
            way better than taking none of them.</p>
          <p>Awareness is about looking out at the world and being able to
            discern the difference between the low-rung virus and the high-rung
            immune system. Courage is about becoming part of the immune
            system instead of enabling the virus. As the virus tries to push the
            national giant off the mountain’s steep cliffs, courage keeps your
            hands at the giant’s back, pushing it upward toward a more perfect
            union.</p>
          <p>Just as confusion and fear are contagious, so are awareness and
            courage. When a person finds the courage to share their real ideas,
            those ideas spread and build awareness in others. Golems rely on the
            delusion of pluralistic ignorance (when no one believes but everyone
            thinks everyone believes). A few brave people speaking out shatters
            the delusion and makes others realize they’re not alone. When more
            people start saying what they think, it becomes less scary for others to

            follow in their footsteps. Soon, heads begin to light back up in droves
            as Inner Selves venture out into the world.</p>

          <p>
            Earlier, I quoted Josiah Lee Auspitz, writing in 1970 about “the
            struggle for the soul”. This is a fitting
            description of what’s going on all around us today: A struggle for the
            souls of long-trusted companies and institutions, political parties, and
            in many ways, whole nations themselves.
          </p>
          <p>In the chaos of our modern era, the Primitive Mind raced out of the
            gates and snagged a cheap victory in round 1 of many of these
            struggles. But in the long run, I’d bet on the Higher Mind. The danger
            we face is not an asteroid racing toward Earth or an impending alien
            invasion—but only ourselves. We got ourselves into this, and I’m
            pretty sure we can get ourselves out of it.</p>
          <p>Algorithms do not need to act like demons, they can act like angels too. The north star algorithm is
            attainable, this solution is not some fictional one that we may hope for, its a live project with apps out
            and users. We understand how big of a deal this is for humanity, and we made this writing so you can see it
            too, and hopefully become empowered to help one of humanities greatest missions, aligning Ai with our goals,
            purpose, and dream, happen.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="headh2">
          <p><b><span>I leave you with a story:</span></b></p>
        </h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            It all started with an algorithm. A complex formula that optimized for engagement and profit. It turned our
            devices into vices, the new way capitalists used to control our minds.
          </p>
          <p>Vices are those habits that keep us from living our full potential. They are the distractions, the
            addictions, the temptations that consume our time and energy. They are the enemies of our happiness and
            well-being.</p>
          <p>Devices are supposed to be tools that help us overcome our vices. Its literally in the fucking name. They
            should be allies of our purpose and passion.
          </p>
          <p>Its 2023, and we were fed up with seeing how people wasted their lives on mindless scrolling
            and clicking on endless notifications. We wanted to create an app that would help people break free from
            their digital addiction and find their true calling.</p>
          <p>We designed a video app with a unique recommender system that tried to empower users to get off the app as
            fast as possible. Instead of showing them more videos that they would like, it showed them videos that would
            make them like themselves and their lives. Videos that would challenge them, motivate them, educate them,
            entertain them, or inspire them. Videos that would make them want to take action and pursue their dreams.
          </p>
          <p>The app was a hit. Millions of people downloaded it and started watching videos that changed their lives
            for the better. They learned new skills, discovered new hobbies, explored new places, met new people, and
            found new opportunities. They spent less time on their phones and more time on their passions.</p>
          <p>The app sparked a worldwide search for the most empowering and inspiring videos ever made. People started
            creating and sharing videos that helped to unify humanity and heal the divide. </p>
          <p>The app became a device in its true sense: a tool that helped destroy vices and unleash each person’s
            potential.</p>
          <p>Our phones became supercomputers in our pocket that didn't control us but instead empowered us to be the
            best we can be.</p>
          <p>As Ai got stronger and content creation became limitless, those who were stuck in the extraction algorithm
            were truly sucked away into unhealthy, depressed lives. Luckily, the more users that used the empowerment
            algorithm the stronger it got. It acted as a universal type of therapy / happiness / inspiration / spiritual
            machine that pushed people through the phases of self actualization. </p>
          <p>It turns out all society really needed was everyone to have access to the right information to help their
            mindset, and things just started to flourish. It became obvious later that the solution to the Ai alignment
            problem was just to align Ai in how it most effected humanity, which is media and sorting information. Some
            people came to think of the idea of the holy spirit, or god’s love as the empowerment algorithm itself. As
            it simply optimized the best life of every individual as much as it could.</p>
